<p class="nonindent">Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are enzymes that hydrolyze and terminate the intracellular actions of cyclic monophosphate second messengers including cAMP in a variety of tissues. Of most relevance to this chapter, human myocardium contains the type III PDE isoenzyme that is bound to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and cleaves active cAMP to its inactive metabolite adenosine monophosphate. Milrinone is a relatively selective bipyridine inhibitor of this cardiac type III PDE that preserves intracellular cAMP concentration by preventing the second messenger&#x2019;s degradation (<strong><a href="#tt13-2">Table 13.2</a></strong>). This action increases systolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> availability by enhancing transsarcolemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to produce a positive inotropic effect independent of the <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor. The inhibition of cAMP metabolism by milrinone simultaneously facilitates diastolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal from the sarcoplasm to enhance the rate and extent of myocardial relaxation. This positive lusitropic effect of milrinone may improve diastolic function in patients with heart failure. Milrinone causes potent systemic and pulmonary arterial vasodilation by attenuating cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) degradation in vascular smooth muscle. Indeed, milrinone produces greater vasodilation than catecholamines including dobutamine and isoproterenol. The combination of positive inotropic effects and arterial vasodilation (&#x201C;inodilator&#x201D;) increases cardiac output in a dose-related manner despite declines in preload resulting from dilation of venous capacitance vessels. Mean arterial pressure may be modestly reduced during infusion of the drug unless additional preload is administered.</p>

<p class="indent">Milrinone decreases pulmonary vascular resistance, and this action may be especially beneficial in patients with pulmonary hypertension who are undergoing cardiac surgery. However, the pulmonary vasodilating properties of milrinone have the potential to increase intrapulmonary shunt and cause arterial hypoxemia. Milrinone causes less pronounced increases in heart rate than catecholamines such as dobutamine, but the PDE inhibitor is arrhythmogenic because of its actions on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Milrinone also inhibits platelet aggregation without producing thrombocytopenia, blunts the inflammatory cytokine response to cardiopulmonary bypass, and dilates native epicardial coronary arteries and arterial graft conduits. These actions are potentially anti-ischemic in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing coronary artery surgery. The relative utility of milrinone as a positive inotrope may be partially attenuated in the failing heart, but not to the degree that is commonly seen with <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor agonists. As a result, the PDE inhibitor continues to effectively enhance myocardial contractility in decompensated heart failure despite the presence of <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor downregulation. Indeed, the combination of milrinone and a <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist is frequently used to assist weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with substantially depressed LV systolic function because of the synergistic actions of these drugs on cAMP-mediated intracellular signaling.</p>
