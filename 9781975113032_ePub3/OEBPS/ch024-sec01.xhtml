<h5 class="h5" id="sen374">A. Component Therapy and Indications for Transfusion</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Blood-product transfusion is conventionally performed with individual component therapy targeted to replace the specific deficiencies at hand. Most patients require only a single blood component or a combination of selected components. For example, red blood cells (RBCs) are needed to treat anemia with evidence of tissue hypoxia, whereas plasma is used to treat coagulopathy and factor deficiencies. Separating blood transfusion into component therapies allows for targeted efficient treatment while also minimizing the risks of transfusion reactions and transfusion-transmitted infection. Whole blood transfusion is reserved for initial emergent treatment of trauma or active bleeding.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Packed red blood cells (PRBCs)</em></strong> are the most common blood product transfused worldwide, with over 10.5 million units administered annually in the United States.<sup><a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> A unit of PRBCs is obtained from a single donor and consists of about 300&#x00A0;mL, with a hematocrit of approximately 60% to 70% and only about 20 to 30&#x00A0;mL of plasma. One unit of PRBCs generally increases the patient&#x2019;s hemoglobin concentration by 1&#x00A0;g/dL. <strong><a href="#tt24-1">Table 24.1</a></strong> describes blood component storage and preparation.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">There is no general rule regarding the minimum hemoglobin at which patients should be transfused. The trigger for transfusion should be individualized for each specific patient.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The clearest indication for PRBC transfusion is acute blood loss or anemia with evidence of inadequate oxygen delivery to the tissues. Patients suffering hypovolemic shock secondary to critical bleeding require resuscitation with PRBCs, but they may also require treatment of dilutional coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. The recommended transfusion threshold during acute hemorrhage in hemodynamically unstable patients is higher to provide oxygen carrying capacity during active bleeding, but still restrictive (hemoglobin goals of &#x003E;7.0-9.0&#x00A0;g/dL) given the risks associated with allogenic blood-product transfusion.<sup><a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup> Transfusion for major bleeding should also include replacement<a id="page506"></a> of coagulation factors and platelets with consideration given to administration of medications and strategies for blood conservation.</p>

<p class="indent">The transfusion threshold for hemodynamically stable patients with anemia has been the topic of many review articles and original studies for over 2&#x00A0;decades. The controversy stems around the balance of the benefits of RBC treatment for anemia and the risks of transfusion. Most international guidelines, including the AABB, formerly the American Association of Blood Banks, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the British Society for Haematology (BSH), and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists, agree that restrictive transfusion practices are indicated for most hemodynamically stable trauma, perioperative, and critically ill patients.<sup><a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib2">2</a>-<a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib6">6</a></sup> There are a few circumstances, such as hemorrhagic shock, major orthopedic surgery with a history of cardiovascular disease, and cardiac surgery, where higher transfusion triggers are indicated to maximize oxygen delivery to end organs under stress. Otherwise, hemodynamically stable patients without evidence of tissue hypoxia (elevated lactate levels, low central venous oxygen saturation) generally tolerate hemoglobin levels as low as 7.0&#x00A0;g/dL with compensatory mechanisms to increase cardiac output and oxygen extraction at the tissue level. <strong><a href="#ff24-1">Figure 24.1</a></strong> describes a suggested clinical algorithm based on international guidelines for patient blood managment.<sup><a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib2">2</a>,<a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib5">5</a>,<a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Plasma</em></strong> contains all the clotting factors, fibrinogen, and plasma proteins from whole blood donation or apheresis. Each unit is collected from a single donor and must be frozen within 6 to 8 hours to be designated fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Most of the plasma currently collected in the United States is frozen within 24 hours (PF24) with minimal detrimental effects on its efficacy. However, it is most appropriate to use the term &#x201C;plasma&#x201D; moving forward as opposed to FFP to account for all types of plasma products.<sup><a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup> The volume of 1 unit of plasma is approximately 250&#x00A0;mL, with physiologic levels of stable clotting factors and approximately 50% to 60% of labile factors VIII and V after 5&#x00A0;days of thawed storage. The most recent report from the National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey (NBCUS) documents significant declines in the transfusion rates of plasma products; however, there are still over 3.2<a id="page507"></a> million plasma units administered annually in the United States.<sup><a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> The most common indications for plasma transfusion are treatment of dilutional coagulopathy and factor deficiency. The current guidelines recommend basing the dose of plasma transfusion therapy on coagulation assay results. However, when testing is not available, the initial recommended dose for factor repletion in a bleeding patient is 10 to 20&#x00A0;mL/kg. Other indications for plasma transfusion include replacement of antithrombin in cases of long-term heparin use or as a second-line agent for warfarin or direct acting oral anticoagulant reversal. There is no indication for the use of plasma as prophylaxis in a patient with abnormal coagulation studies but no bleeding or pending invasive procedure.<sup><a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib8">8</a>,<a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib9">9</a></sup></p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Blood Transfusion Compatibility</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Plasma contains the antibodies to blood type antigens and should therefore be compatible when transfused. <strong><a href="#tt24-2">Table 24.2</a></strong> presents the plasma compatibility profiles as they compare with RBC component compatibility. The ABO blood system is the major carbohydrate-based blood-borne antigen system that induces naturally occurring immunoglobulin-M (IgM) antibodies without the need for RBC exposure. Thus, ABO incompatibility for PRBCs or plasma-containing components carries significant risk of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions (discussed in depth below). Type AB plasma is the universal plasma donor as it does not contain any ABO blood cell antibodies, but limited amounts of group A plasma may be given in emergencies before ABO typing is available. Type O patients are the universal recipient for plasma because there are no A or B antigens in type O blood. The RhD blood group<a id="page508"></a> compatibility is of significant concern in women before and throughout their reproductive age as alloimmunization may result in complications during pregnancy. Alloimmunization is of highest risk in RhD negative patients who receive RhD positive RBCs. Plasma products do not typically contain enough RBCs to cause alloimmunization and may be transfused without concern for RhD compatibility.<sup><a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib9">9</a></sup></p>

<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cryoprecipitate</em></strong> (sometimes simply called &#x201C;cryo&#x201D;) is produced after a controlled thaw and centrifuge of FFP. The yield of cryoproteins that precipitates from 1 unit of FFP is reconstituted in 15 to 20&#x00A0;mL of plasma. It must contain at least 150&#x00A0;mg of fibrinogen and at least 80&#x00A0;international units (IU) of factor VIII. Therefore, a dose of cryoprecipitate is usually pooled from four to six separate donors in approximately 60 to 120&#x00A0;mL and contains a high concentration of fibrinogen relative to plasma, as well as clinically significant amounts of factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, factor XIII, and fibronectin.<sup><a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib8">8</a>,<a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib9">9</a></sup> Hypofibrinogenemia and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) are the most common indications for cryoprecipitate transfusion. Given the low volume of plasma from each donor in a pooled dose of cryoprecipitate, the overall immune-mediated risks are relatively small.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Platelet</em></strong> transfusions have increased approximately 5% over recent years despite an overall reduction in blood-product administration.<sup><a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> This is presumed to be secondary to the aging population and increased incidence of hematopoietic malignancies. Platelets are produced either as a pooled unit from four to six whole blood donors or from a single or double apheresis donation. Unlike other blood components, they have a short shelf life of only 5 to 7&#x00A0;days, and they are stored at room temperature and therefore have carried a higher risk of bacterial contamination. Because of this, pathogen-reduction treatment of platelets, which inactivates bacteria and other pathogens, is being introduced more widely.<sup><a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup> Typically a single dose of platelets (pool or apheresis) is expected to increase the platelet count initially by 25,000 to 30,000 per microliter. However, the response to platelet transfusion varies greatly depending on the indication, acuity, and systemic syndrome of the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">Platelet transfusion may be indicated when platelets are decreased as a result of dilution, bleeding, destruction, or sequestration. Transfusion thresholds for<a id="page509"></a> thrombocytopenia depend on whether the patient has clinical signs of bleeding or whether bleeding or the risk of bleeding involves the closed intraorbital, intracranial, or neuraxial spaces. In these high-risk instances, the transfusion threshold is &#x003C;100,000 per microliter. Otherwise, for surgical patients where bleeding is anticipated and prophylaxis is desired, the threshold is generally &#x003C;50,000 per microliter. Guideline recommendations for lumbar puncture suggest a threshold of at least 40,000 per microliter prior to performing a lumbar puncture and 80,000 for insertion or removal of an epidural catheter. Patients without clinical signs of bleeding are not at risk of spontaneous hemorrhage until the platelet count drops to &#x003C;10,000 per microliter.<sup><a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib8">8</a>,<a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib10">10</a></sup> Platelet transfusion may also be necessary for patients with qualitative deficiencies that are acquired or congenital. Commonly acquired platelet dysfunction occurs with extracorporeal circulation, such as cardiopulmonary bypass, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or with medications or systemic illnesses, such as liver disease and uremia. Concerns for platelet dysfunction in a patient with signs of bleeding should prompt a platelet function test or viscoelastography.<sup><a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup> Cold-stored platelets have very short circulation times but are hemostatically more activated and have been reintroduced by the military because they can be refrigerated for &#x003C;14&#x00A0;days for remote or prehospital use.<sup><a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib11">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Whole blood</em></strong>, usually given as low-titer group O whole blood (LTOWB), can be used for initial emergency transfusions to rapidly provide RBCs, plasma, and platelets simultaneously.<sup><a href="ch024-sec07.xhtml#bib12">12</a></sup> When donors with high anti-A and anti-B ABO antibody titers are avoided, LTOWB can be safely given to non-O patients. Whole blood can be administered as fresh warm units from prescreened walking donors in austere environments or it can be refrigerated for &#x003C;14&#x00A0;days. Practices vary as to antibody titer cutoffs or limits on numbers of units given.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">In an emergency, when a bleeding patient&#x2019;s blood type is not known and there is no time to perform a crossmatch, it is best to transfuse RBCs which are type O, and in females &#x003C;50&#x00A0;years old, RhD-negative.</p>
