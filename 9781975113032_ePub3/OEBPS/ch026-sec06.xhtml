<h4 class="h4" id="sec157">VI. Surgery to the Lower Extremities</h4>
<p class="nonindent">As with upper extremity orthopedic surgery, lower extremity procedures can be performed under regional anesthesia, general anesthesia, or their combination.<sup><a href="ch026-sec09.xhtml#bib14">14</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen409">A. Surgery to the Hip</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hip fractures affect over 4 million people annually worldwide and are associated with billions of dollars in health care costs. Total hip arthroplasties and hemiarthroplasties are among the most common surgical procedures in the United States. Three main types of hip fractures based on anatomical location are <strong><em>intracapsular, intertrochanteric, and subtrochanteric</em></strong>.<sup><a href="ch026-sec09.xhtml#bib15">15</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Intracapsular fracture may cause femoral head ischemia if displaced and often requires hemiarthroplasty. Other types of fractures could be treated with closed or open reduction with percutaneous screw placement or intramedullary nail.</p>
<p class="indent">Reduction in bleeding during hip arthroplasty significantly shortens the operating time and decreases thromboembolism risk. Therefore, a controlled hypotensive epidural anesthesia technique may be an option with a hemodynamic goal to maintain an MAP of 60&#x00A0;mm Hg, in the absence of contraindications sometimes seen in this age group (eg, cerebrovascular disease). With spinal subarachnoid anesthesia, a purposeful unilateral block (either hyperbaric or hypobaric spinal) may offer better hemodynamic stability and early recovery. Surgical cement use is common and its implications are described below.</p>

<p class="dify">As the active baby boomer generation ages, it is anticipated that 1.5 to 3 million total knee replacements will be performed annually by 2030.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen410">B. Surgery to the Knee</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nearly one million total knee arthroplasties are performed annually in the United States. This number is expected to grow to 1.5 to 3 million procedures by 2030 as the active baby boomer population ages. Anesthetic options are presented in <strong><a href="ch026-sec04.xhtml#tt26-8">Table 26.8</a></strong>. Neuraxial anesthesia with indwelling catheter placement and &#x201C;single-shot&#x201D; techniques are frequently used. These may also prevent tourniquet-related pain that has been associated with hypercoagulability.</p>
<p class="indent">Knee arthroscopy is a minimally invasive technique that is usually performed as an ambulatory procedure. Therefore, emphasis is on rapid emergence and early ambulation. Reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament and repair of a torn meniscus are also common procedures of the knee.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen411">C. Surgery to the Ankle and Foot</h5>
<p class="nonindent">With the current advances in surgical techniques and sedation, regional anesthesia is emerging as the anesthetic of choice for foot and ankle surgeries. General anesthesia is administered when regional techniques are contraindicated or for lengthy procedures. The anesthetic management options for the most common foot and ankle surgeries are presented in <strong><a href="#tt26-10">Table 26.10</a></strong>.</p>
