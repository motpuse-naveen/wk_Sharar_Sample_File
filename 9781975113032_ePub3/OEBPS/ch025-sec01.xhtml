<h5 class="h5" id="sen378">A. Terminology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) position statement, MAC is a specific anesthesia service for a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure and may encompass varying levels of sedation.<sup><a href="ch025-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup> Factors when considering the appropriateness of MAC include the type of procedure, the patient&#x2019;s clinical condition, and the potential need to convert to a general or regional anesthetic.<sup><a href="ch025-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup> Furthermore, it includes all aspects of anesthetic care, including a preprocedure visit, intraprocedure care, and postprocedure recovery management.<sup><a href="ch025-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup> The anesthesia provider must be prepared and qualified to convert to general anesthesia when necessary.<sup><a href="ch025-sec04.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> If the patient is unarousable even with painful stimulus, the anesthesia care is a general anesthetic, irrespective of whether airway instrumentation is required.<sup><a href="ch025-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup> ASA standard monitoring, which includes electrocardiography (ECG), pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) monitoring, must be used for every anesthetic including MAC. MAC should be distinguished from moderate sedation. The term moderate<a id="page527"></a> sedation is used to describe a proceduralist-directed service, which does not include a qualified anesthesia provider and is governed by specific institutional policies.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen379">B. Preoperative Assessment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients scheduled for MAC should receive a preoperative assessment equivalent to any other preoperative patient. MAC is unique in that it also requires an element of cooperation on the part of the patient. It is important for the patient to accept the possibility of some degree of awareness during the procedure, be able to tolerate the positioning required for surgery, and, in some instances, communicate with the surgeon or proceduralist.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen380">C. Techniques of MAC</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Successful MAC involves the use of a combination of a sedative-hypnotic and an analgesic agent used in varying doses depending on the goals of the anesthetic and the requirements of the procedure. Regional nerve block performed by an anesthesiologist or local anesthetic administered by the surgeon may improve patient comfort and lower anesthetic requirements. Medications with minimal side effects and short durations of action are preferable in ambulatory anesthesia, where efficiency and rapid recovery are highly desirable.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen381">D. Specific Drugs Used During MAC</h5>
<p class="nonindent">This section will provide a brief description of the drugs most commonly utilized during MAC. For a more in-depth discussion of these medications, the reader is referred to <a href="ch009.xhtml">Chapters 9</a> and <a href="ch010.xhtml">10</a>. <strong><a href="#tt25-1">Table 25.1</a></strong> provides a profile of several drugs commonly used in MAC.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Propofol</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Propofol is a short-acting, intravenous, sedative-hypnotic agent. It is used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia, for procedural sedation, and as a sedative for mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit. Propofol has multiple mechanisms of action, including potentiation of &#x03B3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor activity and sodium channel blockade. It possesses antiemetic and bronchodilator properties and has a short context-sensitive half-life time that is minimally affected by duration of infusion. Bolus and induction doses of propofol should be based on lean body weight; however, infusion dosing should be based on total body weight. In addition to its desired therapeutic effects, propofol also decreases systemic vascular resistance (SVR), blood pressure (BP), cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and intracranial pressure (ICP). Propofol also produces significant respiratory depression, so it requires that the provider be prepared to support the airway. Propofol may produce a burning sensation on administration, especially when injected into a small vein. The most effective strategy to prevent this symptom is pretreatment with lidocaine (3&#x00A0;mL of 1% lidocaine) while occluding the vein proximal to the intravenous insertion site.<sup><a href="ch025-sec04.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup> Despite the addition of additives, propofol is a lipid emulsion that supports rapid bacterial growth. Strict aseptic technique is critical to minimizing contamination risk. Propofol vials should be discarded within 6 hours of opening. Propofol is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Fospropofol</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Fospropofol is a water-soluble prodrug form of propofol. It is metabolized by alkaline phosphatases to its active metabolite, propofol; therefore, its onset<a id="page528"></a> of action is slower than propofol. Potential advantages over propofol include less chance of bacterial contamination, less pain on injection, and lower risk of hyperlipidemia associated with long-term administration. Although fospropofol has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use during MAC, it is not commonly used in clinical practice at this time.</p>

<p class="timage"><img src="images/tt25-1.jpg" alt="img"/></p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Benzodiazepines</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Benzodiazepines, most commonly midazolam, are used to provide anxiolysis and anterograde amnesia. They work by enhancing the effect of GABA at its receptors. Benzodiazepines produce minimal respiratory depression when used alone. They decrease CMRO<sub>2</sub> and CBF but have no appreciable impact on ICP. Benzodiazepines are potent anticonvulsants and may be used to treat status epilepticus and seizures related to local anesthetic toxicity or alcohol withdrawal. Midazolam is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys. In addition to the intravenous route, it can be administered intramuscularly, intranasally, or orally. The oral dose of midazolam is much higher than the intravenous dose due to poor oral bioavailability. Although midazolam has a short elimination half-life, larger doses may be associated with delayed<a id="page529"></a> emergence. Benzodiazepines offer a safety advantage compared to propofol in that there is a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil. However, the effects of midazolam frequently outlast those of flumazenil. Therefore, resedation is a possibility, and flumazenil redosing may be required.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Opioids</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Opioids, most commonly fentanyl, are administered for analgesia. In addition to intravenous administration, opioids may be given by various routes including oral, intramuscular, subcutaneous, transmucosal, and neuraxial. The mechanism of action of opioids is through an agonist action at specific opioid receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems, which in turn decreases the transmission of pain signals. Side effects of opioids include dose-dependent respiratory depression, decreased CBF, delayed gastric emptying, increased urinary sphincter tone leading to urinary retention, and nausea and vomiting. Opioids may also induce skeletal muscle rigidity when large doses are administered rapidly. Chest wall rigidity can be severe enough to make ventilation difficult, and therefore, large doses should be avoided. It is also important to note that opioids alone do not provide amnesia. Opioids are metabolized by the liver and excreted mainly in the urine. Differences in lipid solubility within this class of drugs account for varying pharmacokinetic profiles. Like benzodiazepines, opioids also have a specific antagonist, naloxone. Naloxone can be given to reverse the respiratory effects of opioids but should be used judiciously due to potential adverse side effects such as tachycardia, hypertension, and pulmonary edema. The half-life of naloxone is shorter than most opioids, so the provider must watch for a recrudescence of overdose symptoms; repeated naloxone doses or an infusion may be necessary.</p>

<p class="dify">Opioids alone do not provide amnesia.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Ketamine</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Ketamine is a phencyclidine derivative that produces intense analgesia and amnesia. While small doses may be used as an adjunct in MAC, larger doses can be used to induce general anesthesia. Its primary mechanism of action is antagonism at the <em>N</em>-methyl-<span class="usmall">D</span>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Ketamine can be administered by oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes. Ketamine has bronchodilator properties, making it beneficial in asthmatic patients. Also, in contrast to other sedatives and opioids, it has minimal effect on respiration. In addition to its therapeutic effects, ketamine has traditionally been associated with increased CMRO<sub>2</sub>, CBF, ICP, and increased stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system resulting in increased heart rate (HR) and BP. For these reasons, ketamine is best avoided in patients with increased ICP or intraocular pressure (IOP) and those with coronary artery disease. It should be noted that ketamine may have a paradoxical cardiac effect in patients with disease states associated with catecholamine depletion (eg, septic shock), resulting in direct myocardial depression. Ketamine increases secretions; administration of an antisialagogue such as glycopyrrolate is helpful. Ketamine also produces dissociative amnesia, which is a conscious but trance-like state where the patient is disconnected from the sensory, motor, memory, and emotional functions in the brain. This is uncomfortable for patients and may be minimized by prior administration of a benzodiazepine. Ketamine is metabolized in the liver to norketamine, which has approximately one-fifth the potency of ketamine and may contribute to lingering effects.</p>
<a id="page530"></a>
<h6 class="h6">Dexmedetomidine</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Dexmedetomidine is an intravenous centrally active selective alpha<sub>2</sub>-receptor agonist, which may be used to provide sedation, analgesia, and anxiolysis. Its major benefit is that it has little effect on respiratory drive when used alone. Dexmedetomidine has no intrinsic amnestic properties but can help reduce anesthetic requirements. Side effects of dexmedetomidine include decreased CMRO<sub>2</sub> and CBF, as well as a combination of decreased sympathetic outflow and increased vagal activity, which may precipitate hypotension and severe bradycardia. Dexmedetomidine is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. The context-sensitive half-time is roughly 4 minutes after a 10-minute infusion but can increase to 250 minutes after an 8-hour infusion. Since dexmedetomidine has no amnestic properties, it must be supplemented with a drug such as propofol or midazolam if amnesia is desired.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Ketamine and dexmedetomidine are unique sedative drugs in that they do not suppress ventilatory drive.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen382">E. Patient-Controlled Analgesia and Sedation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is a familiar technique for the management of postoperative pain. PCA has a favorable safety profile compared with intermittent larger boluses of analgesics. In addition, PCA is associated with increased patient satisfaction compared to provider-driven analgesic administration. Patient-controlled sedation has been shown to be effective for use during procedural sedation; however, it is not widely used owing to the cumbersome nature of the setup and safety concerns.<sup><a href="ch025-sec04.xhtml#bib6">6</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen383">F. Respiratory Function and Sedative-Hypnotics</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most of the drugs used during MAC are associated with dose-dependent adverse respiratory effects, which include direct respiratory depression, suppression of normal airway reflexes, and an increase in upper airway resistance.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sedation and the Upper Airway</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Successful ventilation requires coordination of all parts of the airway from the oropharynx to the muscles of the thorax. Patients with preexisting sleep-disordered breathing (obstructive sleep apnea, OSA), lung disease, or neuromuscular disorders are particularly susceptible to developing ventilatory problems while receiving sedation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sedation and Protective Airway Reflexes</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Intact upper airway reflexes are necessary to safeguard against pulmonary aspiration. Many anesthetic drugs have an adverse effect on these protective upper airway reflexes. Patients at risk for aspiration are generally not good candidates for MAC.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sedation and Respiratory Control</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The negative pulmonary effects of anesthetic agents are synergistic when used in combination. Therefore, smaller doses of each must be used. Supplemental oxygen is commonly employed during MAC, as mild hypoventilation and hypoxemia are common.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen384">G. Monitoring During MAC</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>ASA Standards for Basic Anesthetic Monitoring</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">The ASA standards for basic monitoring apply to every anesthetic delivered by an anesthesia provider, regardless of anesthetic type, patient condition, and duration or urgency of the procedure.<sup><a href="ch025-sec04.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup> These standards require that<a id="page531"></a> qualified anesthesia personnel are present in the room throughout the course of all anesthetics and oxygenation, ventilation, circulation, and temperature are continually evaluated. Oxygenation is most commonly monitored by pulse oximetry. An in-line oxygen analyzer, which monitors inspired oxygen concentration, is required for all general anesthetics with an anesthesia machine. Capnography is used to monitor ventilation when an endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway is in place. Although ETCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring became an ASA standard monitor in 2011, it has been shown to be a poor indicator of ventilation in the sedated, spontaneously breathing patient, owing to factors such as mouth breathing or dilution from high oxygen flows. Alarms must be in place to detect absence of ETCO<sub>2</sub>, signifying apnea or a disconnection in components of the breathing system. Circulation is monitored by continuous ECG and pulse oximetry, as well as evaluation of BP and HR at a minimum of 5-minute intervals. Temperature must be monitored when clinically significant changes in body temperature are intended, anticipated, or suspected.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The ASA requires that end-tidal carbon dioxide be measured during all forms of sedation, including MAC.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Communication and Observation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">There is no substitute for a meticulous, focused, and attentive anesthesia provider. While basic monitors are applied for all anesthetics, sight and sound are important tools for the assessment of clinical condition, particularly during MAC.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Recognition and Treatment of Local Anesthetic Toxicity</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Since MAC is often provided as an adjunct to regional, neuraxial, or local anesthesia, it is important for the anesthesia provider to be aware of toxic dose ranges of local anesthetics, to be able to recognize the signs and symptoms of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST), and to be prepared to treat LAST in an expeditious fashion. Symptoms of LAST often begin with numbness of the tongue or perioral area and a metallic taste in the mouth. As the concentration of local anesthetic in the central nervous system increases, patients may report tinnitus or restlessness, which may progress to slurred speech, muscle twitching, and seizures. Sedation may mask the early signs of LAST. The side effects of sedation such as hypercarbia and acidemia, which result in increased CBF and an increase in the ionized form of local anesthetic crossing into the brain, may aggravate central nervous system and cardiac toxicity. Seizures may be treated with a benzodiazepine or propofol. If arrhythmias are present, amiodarone is the drug of choice. Definitive treatment of LAST is intravenous lipid emulsion (see also <a href="ch012.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen385">H. Sedation and Analgesia by Nonanesthesiologists</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The spectrum of anesthetic depth is fluid, meaning there are no concrete demarcations between levels of sedation. Furthermore, the level of sedation intended may differ from the level of sedation achieved. <strong><a href="#tt25-2">Table 25.2</a></strong> defines each of the four levels on the continuum of depth of sedation, as developed by the ASA.<sup><a href="ch025-sec04.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup> The table lists observations regarding patient responsiveness, airway, spontaneous ventilation, and cardiovascular function for each of the four levels of sedation. The goal is for the provider to have early recognition of a patient progressing to a deeper level of sedation than intended. The ASA recommends that nonanesthesia providers tasked with the administration of sedation participate in formal training and be able to demonstrate airway rescue skills such as bag-mask ventilation.</p>
