<h4 class="h4" id="sec3">II. Inhaled Anesthetics</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen1">A. Nitrous Oxide</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Joseph Priestley (1733-1804), an English chemist and clergyman known for his isolation of oxygen in its gaseous form, was also the first to isolate <strong><em>nitrous oxide</em></strong>. Although he did not report on nitrous oxide&#x2019;s possible medical applications, it was his discovery and isolation of this and various other gases that would allow for modern methods of inhaled anesthesia. Sir Humphry Davy (1778-1829) described nitrous oxide&#x2019;s effect on breathing and the central nervous system. In 1800, he stated, &#x201C;As nitrous oxide in its extensive operation appears capable of destroying physical pain, it may probably be used with advantage during surgical operations in which no great effusion of blood takes place.&#x201D; Despite his insight, Davy did not employ nitrous oxide as an anesthetic, but his lasting legacy to history was coining of the phrase <strong><em>&#x201C;laughing gas,&#x201D;</em></strong> which describes nitrous oxide&#x2019;s ability to trigger uncontrollable laughter.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">By 1800, Sir Humphry Davy was aware that nitrous oxide had analgesic properties and that it had potential to be used during surgical procedures. However, it was Horace Wells who, 45&#x00A0;years later, first attempted to use nitrous oxide as a general anesthetic.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Horace Wells (1815-1848) was the first individual to attempt a public demonstration of general anesthesia using nitrous oxide. Wells, a well-known dentist from Hartford, Connecticut, had used nitrous oxide for dental extractions. In 1845, he attempted to publicly perform the painless extraction of a tooth using nitrous oxide. However, possibly due to inadequate administration time or dilution of the gas with air, the patient was not fully insensible to pain and was said to have moved and groaned. Because of this, Wells was discredited and became deeply disappointed at his failed demonstration. Wells spent the better part of his remaining life in self-experimentation and unsuccessfully pursuing recognition for the discovery of inhaled anesthesia.<sup><a href="ch001-sec07.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen2">B. Diethyl Ether</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although the origin of diethyl ether&#x2019;s discovery is debated, it may first have been synthesized by the eighth-century Arabian philosopher Jabir ibn Hayyan or 13th-century European alchemist Raymundus Lully.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Physicians and chemists were familiar with the compound, diethyl ether, for centuries before it was used as a general anesthetic.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">By the 16th century, Paracelsus and others were preparing this compound and noting its effects on consciousness. Paracelsus documented that diethyl ether could produce drowsiness in chickens, causing them to become unresponsive and then wake up without any adverse effects. In the 17th and 18th centuries, ether was sold as a pain reliever, and numerous famous scientists of the time examined its properties. Because of its effects on consciousness, it also became a popular recreational drug in Britain and Ireland as well as in America, where festive group events with ether were called &#x201C;ether frolics.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Although many were aware of the effects of inhaled ether, it was a physician from Georgia who first administered ether with the deliberate purpose of producing surgical anesthesia. <strong><em>Crawford Williamson Long</em></strong> (1815-1878) administered ether as a surgical anesthetic on March 30, 1842, to James M. Venable for the removal of a neck tumor. However, his results were not published until<a id="page3"></a> 1849, 3&#x00A0;years after William T. G. Morton&#x2019;s famous public demonstration. This was not from a lack of insight, but rather a lack of desire for recognition. When he finally did publish his experiments with ether, he stated he did so at the bequest of his friends who felt he would be remiss not to state his involvement in the history of inhalation anesthesia.</p>

<p class="indent">On October 16, 1846, William T. G. Morton (1819-1868) induced general anesthesia with ether, which allowed surgeon John Collins Warren (1778-1856) to remove a vascular tumor from Edward Gilbert Abbott. The anesthetic was delivered through an inhaler consisting of a glass bulb containing an ether-soaked sponge and a spout at the other end through which the patient could breathe. The glass bulb was open to room air, allowing the patient to breathe in fresh air that mixed with the ether inside the bulb before passing through the spout and into the patient&#x2019;s lungs. The event occurred in a surgical amphitheater at the Massachusetts General Hospital, known today as the <strong><em>Ether Dome</em></strong> (<strong><a href="#ff1-1">Figure 1.1</a></strong>). News of the demonstration spread quickly, and within a matter of months, the possibility of painless surgery was known around the world.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen3">C. The Ether Controversy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In all, Morton completed three trials at the Massachusetts General Hospital before the hospital deemed it safe for use. Although today Morton is usually credited with this discovery, at the time, those involved were aware that Charles T. Jackson was the intellectual discoverer of this process and Morton was simply its executor. Charles Jackson (1805-1880), a notable Boston physician, chemist, and Morton&#x2019;s preceptor, stated that he counseled Morton on the use of inhaled ether for insensibility to pain.<sup><a href="ch001-sec07.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The ether controversy refers to the acrimonious arguments that ensued among the various individuals who believed they deserved the credit for having introduced inhalation anesthesia.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Shortly after Morton&#x2019;s demonstration, Henry Jacob Bigelow (1818-1890), professor emeritus in the Department of Surgery at Harvard Medical School, described his famous account of the events that transpired at Massachusetts General Hospital, proclaiming that Morton and Jackson had discovered how<a id="page4"></a> to render patients insensible to pain. The article, published in the <strong><em>Boston Medical and Surgical Journal</em></strong> (the predecessor to the <strong><em>New England Journal of Medicine</em></strong>), was widely distributed.<sup><a href="ch001-sec07.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> The news reached Horace Wells, who contended that he had discovered inhaled anesthetics through his use of nitrous oxide. It was these assertions that would lead to what is now called the <strong><em>&#x201C;ether controversy.&#x201D;</em></strong> The debate was made worse by what was most likely an attempt for monetary reward, with Morton&#x2019;s subsequent denial of Jackson&#x2019;s share in the discovery, leading to all three being pitted against one another.<sup><a href="ch001-sec07.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup></p>

<p class="indent">The controversy would destroy both the reputations and lives of those involved, and to this day, it lives on through various monuments throughout New England and other areas of the nation avowing credit to those depicted. It should be noted that, although not usually cited as being involved in the ether controversy, Crawford Long did publish his accounts of his use of ether. As such, there are various monuments asserting his place in the history of anesthesia (<strong><a href="#ff1-2">Figure 1.2</a></strong>).</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Open Drop Ether</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">After Morton&#x2019;s famous demonstration, Henry Jacob Bigelow and his father Jacob Bigelow wrote letters to English physicians Francis Boott and Robert Liston, respectively. Boott, a general practitioner, and Liston, a surgeon, conducted Europe&#x2019;s first successful administration of surgical anesthesia with ether in December 1846, leading to Liston&#x2019;s famous words, &#x201C;Well gentlemen, this Yankee Dodge sure beats <strong><em>mesmerism</em></strong> hollow.&#x201D; News traveled fast, and use of ether anesthesia swiftly found its way throughout the European continent.</p>
<a id="page5"></a>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen5">E. Chloroform</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although <strong><em>chloroform</em></strong> had been discovered nearly 2&#x00A0;decades earlier, it was not used as a surgical anesthetic until a year after Morton&#x2019;s demonstration in 1847. James Young Simpson, a Scottish obstetrician, had learned of ether&#x2019;s effects after Liston&#x2019;s successful operation and had employed it with some of his patients. Although it did relieve some of the suffering associated with childbirth, Simpson was not satisfied and began to search for a better solution. Through the advice of a chemist, he became aware of chloroform and its anesthetizing effects. On November 4, 1847, he and two friends imbibed the contents of a bottle containing chloroform. Needless to say, they were satisfied by their self-experimentation and Simpson began using chloroform to relieve the pain of childbirth.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen6">F. Critics of Anesthesia</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The anesthetic use of chloroform and ether was not without its skeptics, and arguments against its use were made on moral, religious, and physiologic grounds. However, unlike ether, in Europe, chloroform use was more easily legitimized through the scientific logic of <strong><em>John Snow</em></strong>, who proclaimed its safety over ether and would eventually administer it to Queen Victoria during the birth of Prince Leopold. Perhaps because of the widespread use of chloroform and the effect a monarch can have on its citizens, the use and study of surgical anesthesia prospered in the 19th-century Europe, while in the United States it remained comparatively stagnant.</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen7">G. The Birth of Modern Surgical Anesthesia</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The aforementioned London physician John Snow (1813-1858), best known for his epidemiologic work on cholera showing that the source was a public water pump, could also be called the first true anesthetist (the British equivalent of an anesthesiologist). As was his manner, he delved deeply into the study and understanding of volatile anesthetics. Unlike Morton, Wells, and Jackson, Snow was not worried about his role and potential legacy in medicine, but rather with the safe and proper administration of anesthesia. His calm and attentive attitude in the operating theater and focus on the patient&#x2019;s well-being, rather than his self-pride, is a model to be emulated.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen8">H. Modern Inhaled Anesthetics</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Perhaps Snow&#x2019;s intense study of the mechanism of action and possible side effects of inhaled anesthetics inspired the quest for an ideal inhalation anesthetic. Throughout the 20th century, various drugs such as ethyl chloride, ethylene, and cyclopropane were used for surgical anesthesia. But these were eventually abandoned due to a variety of drawbacks such as their pungent nature, weak potency, and flammability. The discovery that <strong><em>fluorination</em></strong> contributed to making anesthetics more stable, less toxic, and less combustible led to the introduction of halothane in the 1950s. The 1960s and 1970s would bring about various fluorinated anesthetics such as methoxyflurane and enflurane. These were eventually discontinued due to untoward side effects. Although initially more difficult to synthesize and purify, isoflurane, an isomer of enflurane, had fewer side effects than previous agents. It has been used since the late 1970s and is still a popular inhalation anesthetic today. There were no further advances in inhaled anesthetics until the introduction of desflurane in 1992 and sevoflurane in 1994. Both of these agents, along with isoflurane and nitrous oxide, are the most widely used inhaled agents today.</p>
