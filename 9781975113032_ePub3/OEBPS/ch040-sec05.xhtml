<h4 class="h4" id="sec255">V. Hypoxia</h4>
<p class="nonindent">There are several potential causes of hypoxia in the postoperative patient. The most common cause of V/Q mismatch in the PACU is atelectasis. Factors predisposing to atelectasis include obesity, prolonged supine or Trendelenburg intraoperative positioning, increased intra-abdominal pressure, lack of cough or deep breathing under anesthesia, and postoperative splinting due to pain. This can be exacerbated by increased O<sub>2</sub> demand in the setting of pain, shivering, and agitation. For this reason, most postoperative patients will continue to require supplemental oxygen in the postoperative period until they regain their functional residual capacity (FRC) with mobilization and good pulmonary toilet. It is important to be aware that supplemental O<sub>2</sub>, while frequently useful, may mask hypoventilation caused by residual anesthesia or sedative medications.</p>
<p class="indent">Less common etiologies to keep in mind for the hypoxic postoperative patient include airway compromise, pulmonary edema (from volume overload, negative pressure, or re-expansion) pulmonary embolus, aspiration pneumonitis, or mucous plugging. Pneumothoraces may occur after breast, neck, or thoracic surgery or potentially from abdominal surgery involving compromise of the diaphragm.</p>
<p class="indent">Workup of the hypoxic postoperative patient should include initial assessment of level of consciousness, airway patency, adequacy of respiratory effort, and breath sounds. Persistent or profound hypoxia should be further assessed with chest x-ray (CXR) and ABG analysis. Point of care ultrasound is now frequently used to help identify signs of pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or consolidation. In the setting of pulmonary edema or profound atelectasis, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may be used to potentially avoid reintubation for hypoxia<sup><a href="ch040-sec16.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup> (<strong><a href="#ff40-2">Figure 40.2</a></strong>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen712">A. Airway Compromise</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Postanesthesia patients are at high risk for airway obstruction. Signs of potential airway compromise and obstruction include stridor, increased work of breathing, apneic episodes, or neck swelling. Patients at particular risk are those with known or suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and patients who have had procedures on the neck and upper airway.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients recovering from thyroid, parathyroid, and carotid surgery are at risk of developing localized neck hematomas that may distort airway anatomy leading to respiratory compromise. Surgical teams should be notified and rapid hematoma expansion may necessitate reopening of the incision at bedside. Intubation in this scenario may be very difficult or impossible due to altered anatomy, and efforts should be made to maintain<a id="page840"></a> spontaneous respiration during any intubation attempt. In the absence of obvious neck hematoma, vocal cord injury, edema, or spasm may be the cause of symptoms. Racemic epinephrine and steroids may help if airway edema is thought to be the cause, and ENT evaluation should be considered. Airway compromise can also be the result of postsurgical oropharyngeal bleeding after procedures such as tonsillectomy, and these patients require close monitoring.</p>
