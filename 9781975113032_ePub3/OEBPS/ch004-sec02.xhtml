<h4 class="h4" id="sec32">II. The Autonomic Nervous System</h4>
<p class="nonindent">As is apparent from its name, the autonomic nervous system functions independent of our conscious efforts. The system controls smooth muscles, heart muscle, endocrine/exocrine glands, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, and other functions related to our body&#x2019;s homeostasis.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The total volume of cerebral spinal fluid is 150&#x00A0;mL, of which 50&#x00A0;mL is in the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The autonomic nervous system has two output divisions. The sympathetic division (sympathetic nervous system [SNS]) is adrenergic and mediates our body&#x2019;s fight-or-flight response, among others. The parasympathetic division (parasympathetic nervous system [PNS]) is cholinergic and mediates our body&#x2019;s rest-and-digest actions, among others (<strong><a href="#tt4-1">Table 4.1</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">The output neurons of the autonomic nervous system are motor neurons. Unlike motor pathways of the peripheral nervous system where one neuron connects the central nervous system with the target organ (skeletal muscle), each autonomic pathway has two motor neurons connected in series. The cell body of the first neuron (preganglionic neuron) is located in the brain or spinal cord, with its myelinated axon connecting to a second neuron (postganglionic neuron) within an autonomic ganglion. The unmyelinated axon of a second neuron (extends to the visceral target organ) (<strong><a href="#ff4-4">Figures 4.4</a>-<a href="#ff4-6">4.6</a></strong>). Alternatively, in some autonomic pathways, the preganglionic neuron connects to specialized cells within the adrenal medulla (chromaffin cells) instead of to a postganglionic neuron.</p>
<p class="indent">The main afferent input to the autonomic nervous system comes from autonomic (visceral) sensory neurons. Mostly these neurons transmit input from interoceptors, a set of sensory receptors located in the blood vessels, visceral organs, muscles, and the nervous system, and monitor internal environmental conditions of our bodies. For example, chemoreceptors monitor oxygen levels in our blood and mechanoreceptors monitor stretch in organ walls. Angina pectoris is a specific example of a visceral sensation: that is, a sensation of pain triggered by heart muscle suffering from ischemia.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen66">A. Sympathetic Division</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The classic SNS action is the fight-or-flight response&#x2014;it is a series of immediate activities leading to increased alertness and metabolic activities to prepare the body for an emergency by increasing alertness, heart and breathing rate.</p>
<p class="indent">Preganglionic fibers of the SNS take origin from the gray matter of the spinal cord, travel through ventral roots of spinal nerves from the first thoracic to the second lumbar segments of the spinal cord, and comprise &#x201C;thoracolumbar outflow.&#x201D; These small diameter myelinated fibers quickly leave the spinal nerves and synapse with the postganglionic neurons located at the chains of paravertebral sympathetic ganglia running in two parallel columns anterolateral to the vertebrae. The unmyelinated axons of the postganglionic neurons usually return to the spinal nerves to travel peripherally to connect to their visceral effectors (<strong><a href="#ff4-5">Figure 4.5</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">The sympathetic ganglia are the sites of synapses between pre- and postganglionic sympathetic neurons. There are two major types of sympathetic ganglia: sympathetic trunk ganglia and the prevertebral ganglia. Sympathetic trunk ganglia extend from the base of the skull to the coccyx. Postganglionic axons from sympathetic trunk ganglia innervate organs above the diaphragm. Sympathetic trunk ganglia in the neck have specific names: superior cervical, middle cervical, and inferior cervical. Anatomic fusion of the first thoracic and inferior cervical ganglia is called a stellate ganglion. It carries sympathetic fibers from the face and upper extremity and is frequently blocked with local anesthetic as a treatment for complex regional pain syndrome of the upper extremity. In contrast, the prevertebral (collateral) ganglia lie anterior to the vertebral column and close to major abdominal arteries. Postganglionic axons from prevertebral ganglia innervate organs of the abdominal cavity below the diaphragm. There are five major prevertebral ganglia: celiac, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric, aorticorenal, and renal.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen67">B. Parasympathetic Division</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The PNS is often referred to as the rest-and-digest division because one of its primary activities is to conserve and restore body energy. The majority of its output is directed to the smooth muscles and glands of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Preganglionic neurons of the PNS take origin from the cranial nerves III, VII, IX, and X in brainstem, as well as lateral gray matter of the second, third, and fourth sacral segments of the spinal cord conus medullaris, and comprise &#x201C;craniosacral outflow.&#x201D; These fibers travel in the cranial and sacral nerves to the neuronal bodies of the postganglionic neurons that are located in ganglia near or inside the effector organ. The secondary neuron&#x2019;s postganglionic axons are usually very short and continue to specific muscles or glands within the target viscera.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen68">C. Autonomic Nervous System Transmission Process</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Generation of an action potential in the autonomic neuron starts the nerve conduction cascade and signal transmission. There are multiple factors affecting the speed of signal conduction: nerve fiber diameter, number of synapses, presence of myelin, and presence of nodes of Ranvier enabling salutatory conduction. The signal between neurons is transmitted at the ganglia across the synaptic cleft by release of special substances (neurotransmitters) from the terminal end of the preganglionic neuron. These neurotransmitters attach to a receptor of the postganglionic neuron or the effector cell and leads to a physiologic response (<strong><a href="#ff4-7">Figure 4.7</a></strong>).</p>

Afferent impulses are integrated centrally and sent reflexively to the adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. Sympathetic fibers ending in the adrenal medulla are preganglionic, and acetylcholine (ACh) is the neurotransmitter. Stimulation of the chromaffin cells, acting as postganglionic neurons, releases epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NE). (From Grecu L. Autonomic nervous system: physiology and pharmacology.

<h5 class="h5" id="sen69">D. Autonomic Neurotransmitters</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The nerve terminals of both sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic fibers secrete acetylcholine, and are therefore termed &#x201C;cholinergic.&#x201D; Parasympathetic postganglionic fibers are cholinergic as well. In contrast, most sympathetic postganglionic fibers secrete norepinephrine (except those in sweat glands) and are therefore termed &#x201C;adrenergic&#x201D; (<strong><a href="#ff4-5">Figure 4.5</a></strong>).</p>

<p class="dify">Neurotransmitters norepinephrine and epinephrine released into the circulation from the adrenal medulla are called hormones.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The different postganglionic neurotransmitters used by sympathetic and parasympathetic postganglionic fibers explain the different effects the SNS and PNS have on effector organs. Most organs are innervated by both divisions, usually with opposing actions (<strong><a href="#tt4-1">Table 4.1</a></strong>). For example, the heart receives dual innervation that balances an increase in heart rate (SNS) against a decrease in heart rate (PNS). However, some organs are predominantly controlled by one of the divisions. For example, the SNS continuously stimulates smooth muscles in the walls of the arteries, maintaining them partially constricted (sympathetic tone). Decreasing sympathetic stimulation of the blood vessels leads to vasodilation and a reduction in the blood pressure.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Autonomic Nervous System</strong></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen70">E. Cholinergic Neurons and Receptors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The cholinergic neurons include all sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, sympathetic postganglionic neurons that innervate most sweat glands, and all parasympathetic postganglionic neurons. These neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter.</p>
<p class="indent">Acetylcholine is stored in synaptic vesicles at the terminal end of the neuron and released by exocytosis when triggered by a release of calcium ions from the interstitial space. Acetylcholine containing vesicles diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind with cholinergic receptors in the postsynaptic cell membrane. Acetylcholine cannot be recycled; thus, it is continuously synthesized in the presynaptic nerve terminal. The synthesis (acetylation of choline by acetyl coenzyme A) is catalyzed by an enzyme choline acetyltransferase. Rapid destruction of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft is essential for rapid return of the effector organs to baseline condition. The rapid destruction of acetylcholine in the synapse is produced by acetylcholinesterase and pseudocholinesterase (plasma cholinesterases). These enzymes hydrolyze acetylcholine, ester-type local anesthetics, and succinylcholine, among others.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two types of cholinergic receptors: nicotinic and muscarinic. Nicotinic receptors (nicotine mimics the action of the acetylcholine when binding to these receptors) are present in dendrites and cell bodies of both sympathetic and parasympathetic postganglionic neurons, chromaffin cell of the adrenal medulla, and in the motor end plate at the skeletal neuromuscular junction. Muscarinic receptors (the mushroom poison muscarine mimics action of acetylcholine when binding to these receptors) are present in the membranes of all effector organs (smooth and cardiac muscles and glands) innervated by parasympathetic postganglionic fibers. Sweat glands receive most of their innervation from cholinergic sympathetic postganglionic neurons and possess muscarinic receptors.</p>
<p class="indent">Binding of acetylcholine to nicotinic receptors results in depolarization (excitation) of the postsynaptic cell (eg, postganglionic neuron, autonomic effector cell, or skeletal muscle cell). Binding of acetylcholine to muscarinic receptors can result in either depolarization (excitation) or hyperpolarization (inhibition) depending on the type of a neuron. For example, smooth muscles in the iris of the eye will contract, whereas smooth muscle in gastrointestinal sphincters will relax, once acetylcholine binds their muscarinic receptors.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>1. Adrenergic Neurons and Receptors</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">The sympathetic postganglionic neurons predominately use norepinephrine as a neurotransmitter (epinephrine plays a minor role). Like acetylcholine, norepinephrine is stored in presynaptic vesicles and is released by exocytosis into the synaptic cleft where it binds to specific adrenergic receptors causing either excitation or inhibition of the effector cell. Adrenergic receptors can bind both epinephrine (released as a hormone) and norepinephrine (released as a neurotransmitter or as a hormone secreted directly into the blood by chromaffin cells of adrenal medulla).</p>
<p class="indent">The two main types of the adrenergic receptors found on viscera innervated by most sympathetic postganglionic neurons are alpha (&#x03B1;) and beta (&#x03B2;) (<strong><a href="#tt4-2">Table 4.2</a></strong>). There are further subtypes of the receptors based on either their activation response or anatomic distribution: &#x03B1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x03B2;<sub>1</sub> are generally excitatory, &#x03B1;<sub>2</sub> and &#x03B2;<sub>2</sub> are generally inhibitory, and &#x03B2;<sub>3</sub> are present only on brown adipose tissue and lead to thermogenesis when activated. Most effector cells have either &#x03B1; or &#x03B2; receptors; a minority has both. Norepinephrine has higher affinity to &#x03B1; receptors, while epinephrine stimulates both &#x03B1; and &#x03B2; equally.</p>
<a id="page83"></a>
<div class="table">
<p class="TABLEpNUM" id="tt4-2"><strong><span class="tab">Table&#160;4.2</span> Adrenergic Receptors</strong></p>
<p class="timage"><img src="images/tt4-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<a id="page84"></a>
<p class="timage"><img src="images/tt4-2a.jpg" alt=""/></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The primary mechanism of norepinephrine termination in the synaptic cleft is via reuptake into presynaptic neuronal terminals, where they undergo enzymatic destruction by either catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) to form vanillylmandelic acid that is excreted in urine. The metabolism of norepinephrine takes longer then acetylcholine; thus, norepinephrine effects last longer then acetylcholine.</p>
<p class="indent">Multiple medications are used to activate or block specific adrenergic and cholinergic receptors to modulate the desired effects of norepinephrine and epinephrine on human tissues. For example, phenylephrine is an adrenergic agonist at &#x03B1;<sub>1</sub> receptors that is frequently used intraoperatively to increase mean arterial pressure by induced vasoconstriction (ie, increased afterload). Esmolol is a selective &#x03B2;<sub>1</sub> blocker that is frequently used to rapidly decrease in heart rate and blood pressure through its inhibitory effects on cardiac chronotropy and inotropy, respectively.</p>
<h6 class="h6">2. Autonomic Nervous System Reflexes</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The primary role of the autonomous nervous system is to rapidly modulate the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic responses to changes in our homeostatic environment. The balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity is termed &#x201C;sympathetic tone&#x201D; and is regulated by the hypothalamus&#x2014;increasing sympathetic activity and decreasing the parasympathetic activity as needed to maintain the proper tone.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">In general, the number of adrenergic receptors is inversely proportional to the concentration of circulating catecholamines.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">During times of physical or emotional stress, the sympathetic division of the autonomous nervous system predominates. High sympathetic tone supports body<a id="page85"></a> functions needed for the fight-or-flight response: pupils dilate, heart rate and contractility increase, airways dilate, and blood flow is redirected to organs involved in a fight response (eg, skeletal muscle). In contrast, during periods of inactivity, the parasympathetic division predominates, prioritizing rest-and-digest activities (eg, gastrointestinal tract actions allowing us to better digest food).</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Orthostatic hypotension is a harbinger of an increase in perioperative morbidity and mortality and should be considered an additional risk factor for a given patient.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Not surprisingly, the sympathetic effects are more widespread and longer lasting than parasympathetic ones. Afterall, one&#x2019;s survival depends on how quickly and for how long the sympathetic division&#x2019;s responses can be activated and sustained. Three physiologic mechanisms allow that to happen: sympathetic postganglionic fibers diverge more extensively allowing for simultaneous activation of many organ systems; norepinephrine inactivation mechanisms allow it to remain much longer than acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft; and the adrenal medulla supplements neuronal supply of norepinephrine and epinephrine by secreting both substances directly into the circulation.</p>
<p class="indent">If autonomic pathways are disrupted either by a pathologic condition or as a side effect of medications, a loss of normal function is expected. An example of such a condition is pharmacologic disruption of the cervical sympathetic ganglia with local anesthetic following a stellate ganglion block or a brachial plexus block done via interscalene approach. This disruption results in development of Horner syndrome: the combination of ptosis, myosis, and anhidrosis due to unopposed action of parasympathetic fibers in these anatomic distributions.</p>
<p class="indent">A common example of naturally occurring autonomic dysfunction is orthostatic hypotension&#x2014;a sustained decrease of systolic blood pressure by 20&#x00A0;mm Hg or of diastolic blood pressure by 10&#x00A0;mm Hg upon rapidly changing position from a supine or sitting position to a standing position. When functioning normally, SNS activity is quickly enhanced upon standing (as carotid baroreceptors sense the initial, gravity-induced fall in blood pressure), leading to a rapid compensatory increase in both vasoconstriction and cardiac output, thereby augmenting blood pressure and minimizing the clinical effects of orthostatic hypotension. With aging and/or use of beta-blocker medications, this compensatory SNS reflex is impaired, which can result in lightheadedness or even transient syncope when rapidly assuming a standing position.</p>
