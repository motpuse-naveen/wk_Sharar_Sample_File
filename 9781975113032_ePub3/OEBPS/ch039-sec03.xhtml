<p class="nonindent">Significant adverse events in NORA are rare; however, malpractice closed claims analysis<sup><a href="ch039-sec05.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup> demonstrate that while claims for NORA were less frequent than for OR anesthesia, NORA had a higher proportion of claims for death than operating room settings. NORA claims were most frequently seen in cardiology and radiology locations. NORA complications were more likely to occur during monitored anesthesia care and be related to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation. Furthermore, aspiration pneumonitis occurred in a higher proportion of NORA malpractice claims than it did in the operating room.</p>
