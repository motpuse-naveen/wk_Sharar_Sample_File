<p class="nonindent">Airway resistance to gas flow must also be overcome by the respiratory system. Normal airway resistance is 1-3&#x00A0;cm&#x00A0;H<sub>2</sub>O/L/sec.<sup><a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup> During a respiratory cycle, gas simultaneously flows both in laminar and turbulent patterns. The physics of the two gas flow patterns are markedly different, altering the airway resistance presented to the respiratory system.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen23">A. Laminar Flow</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In laminar gas flow, the velocity of gas decreases away from the center of gas flow. In other words, maximal gas flow velocity is in the centermost area of gas flow. This type of flow is usually inaudible on physical examination. Resistance to laminar flow is described by the following equation:</p>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/16-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="indent">In laminar flow, airway radius influences resistance to gas flow by a power of 4. Viscosity increases resistance, but density has no effect on resistance in laminar gas flow. Less dense gases such as helium will not improve gas flow in the setting of laminar flow.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen24">B. Turbulent Flow</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Flow through branched or disordered tubes often produces a disruption of laminar flow resulting in turbulent flow. At high flow rates, turbulent flow can occur even in an unbranched system. In contrast to laminar flow, where the centermost gas has the maximum velocity, turbulent flow advances at<a id="page17"></a> the same velocity throughout the gas stream. The mathematical computation of turbulent flow is complex. Resistance to gas flow is proportional to the flow rate of gas in turbulent flow in contrast to laminar flow where resistance is inversely proportional to flow rate. Although laminar flow is sensitive to changes in radius, turbulent flow is even more so sensitive to changes in radius. Changes in airway radius result in a change in resistance to a power of five in turbulent flow, whereas in laminar flow, the change in resistance is to a power of four. Lastly, resistance to turbulent flow is directly proportional to gas density rather than viscosity. As gas density decreases, resistance decreases as well. It is in cases of turbulent flow and increased airway resistance that less dense gases such as helium are useful<sup><a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib2">2</a>,<a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup> (<strong><a href="#ff2-2">Figure 2.2</a></strong>).</p>

<p class="dify">Helium is useful to decrease resistance to flow only if flow is turbulent&#x2014;as one might observe during asthma.</p>
