<p class="nonindent">Calcium is found in plasma in three states: bound to albumin (50%); bound to phosphate, bicarbonate, or citrate (5%-10%); and free ionized calcium (40%-45%) (<strong><a href="#ff18-8">Figure 18.8</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch018-sec07.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> It is the <strong><em>ionized calcium</em></strong> that plays a critical role in regulating muscle contraction, coagulation, neurotransmitter release, and <a id="page393"></a>second messenger intracellular functions. Ionized calcium concentration is affected by blood pH and temperature, both of which alter Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to albumin. Alkalosis causes a decrease in ionized calcium, while acidosis causes an increase in ionized calcium.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong><em>Parathyroid hormone (PTH)</em></strong> is secreted by the parathyroid glands and is intricately involved in the regulation of plasma calcium (<strong><a href="#ff18-9">Figure 18.9</a></strong>). PTH maintains extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration through direct effects on the bone and kidneys. PTH triggers osteoclastic activity in bones, leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate release. In the kidneys, PTH promotes Ca<sup>2+</sup> resorption and phosphate excretion in the distal tubule. It also promotes the synthesis of<a id="page394"></a> 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which increases intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. PTH secretion is primarily regulated by the serum ionized Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen279">A. Hyperparathyroidism</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Excess PTH leads to <strong><em>hypercalcemia</em></strong>. Nephrolithiasis is the most common presenting complaint. Other common symptoms include polyuria, polydipsia, generalized muscle weakness, and fatigue. Peptic ulceration, constipation, and psychiatric complaints may also be present. Hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed by increased serum levels of PTH and calcium. Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually caused by a PTH-secreting parathyroid adenoma. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a compensatory increase in PTH and is seen in conditions that cause either hypocalcemia or hyperphosphatemia (eg, chronic renal failure). Hydration with intravenous normal saline is the first step in the treatment of hypercalcemia. Loop diuretics can be used to enhance renal calcium excretion; however, this intervention rarely is used in contemporary practice. Calcitonin inhibits PTH secretion and osteoclastic bone resorption and is<a id="page395"></a> effective for 24 to 48 hours, after which resistance develops. Bisphosphonates, which decrease osteoclastic activity, may also be used. Glucocorticoids are effective in reducing serum calcium concentration in some conditions (sarcoidosis, malignancy), but have little role in the treatment of primary hypercalcemia. Severe hypercalcemia should be treated prior to elective surgery. In cases of benign adenoma, surgical excision is curative. Anesthetic implications of hypercalcemia are detailed in <strong><a href="#tt18-13">Table 18.13</a></strong>.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen280">B. Hypoparathyroidism</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hypoparathyroidism is a relatively uncommon condition. In infants and children, it is usually the result of a genetic condition. In adults, hypoparathyroidism is most often acquired from iatrogenic or autoimmune damage to the parathyroid gland. Patients with <strong><em>hypoparathyroidism</em></strong> may present with numbness, paresthesias, muscle spasms, altered mental status, or behavioral disturbances. Rarely, seizures may occur. Cardiovascular manifestations reflect the effects of hypocalcemia and include congestive heart failure, hypotension, and prolonged QT interval. Hypocalcemia in the setting of a low PTH confirms the diagnosis. Treatment involves replacement of electrolytes with oral or intravenous calcium and vitamin D analogues. Clinical manifestations of hypocalcemia are detailed in <strong><a href="#tt18-14">Table 18.14</a></strong>.</p>

<p class="dify">Propofol can interfere with rapid PTH assay and should not be used for at least 15 minutes prior to measurement of a serum PTH level.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen281">C. Anesthetic Implications of Parathyroid Surgery</h5>
<p class="nonindent">General anesthesia with endotracheal tube or a laryngeal mask airway is most often used for parathyroid surgery. Regional anesthesia can be used for minimally invasive parathyroidectomies. In some cases, a rapid PTH assay is used intraoperatively to allow confirmation that the hyperfunctioning gland has been removed successfully. As during thyroid surgery, <strong><em>recurrent laryngeal nerve injury</em></strong> is a concern and may cause postoperative hoarseness or airway compromise. <strong><em>Hypocalcemia</em></strong> due to <strong><em>hypoparathyroidism</em></strong> can develop after parathyroid surgery and may require intravenous calcium supplementation.</p>
