<p class="nonindent">The single most important principle of patient positioning is &#x201C;to do no harm.&#x201D; Anesthesiologists often reduce or eliminate the ability of patients to sense the positions in which they have been placed for procedures by giving amnesic, analgesic, and anesthetic drugs. Thus, it is the responsibility of anesthesiologists, as well as other members of the surgical team, to ensure that patients are not placed into positions that may lead to injury.</p>
