<h5 class="h5" id="sen765">A. Grounded Power Systems and the Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The electrical power supply illustrated in both <strong><a href="ch044-sec02.xhtml#ff44-1">Figures 44.1</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#ff44-2">44.2</a></strong> is referred to as a &#x201C;grounded power system.&#x201D; It is given this name because the potential of the neutral wire is fixed at the same potential as the ground wire, which in turn is fixed at the same potential as the actual ground (ie, the physical surface of the Earth).</p>
<p class="indent">As shown in <strong><a href="ch044-sec02.xhtml#ff44-1">Figure 44.1</a></strong>, although a ground wire within a malfunctioning device can reduce the amount of electric shock current flowing through a person touching that device, it cannot eliminate that shock current entirely. In the scenario shown in <strong><a href="ch044-sec02.xhtml#ff44-1">Figure 44.1</a></strong>, the device will continue to pose an ongoing risk of electrical shock. Furthermore, this risk of shock will likely not be discovered until someone touches the device and experiences a shock. The grounded power system shown in <strong><a href="ch044-sec02.xhtml#ff44-1">Figure 44.1</a></strong> represents the standard for domestic electrical wiring, but it is inadequately safe for the OR.<sup><a href="ch044-sec06.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><strong><a href="#ff44-2">Figure 44.2</a></strong> demonstrates a refinement of this electrical system, making use of a device called a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI). A GFCI is an electrical device that monitors the ground wire to detect whether any current is flowing in that wire. GFCIs are available as individual units that can be plugged into normal electrical sockets, or alternatively, electrical sockets can<a id="page914"></a> be purchased and installed such that the GFCI circuitry is contained within the socket itself. <strong><a href="#ff44-2">Figure 44.2</a></strong> shows this latter type of installation.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p class="indent">Under normal operating conditions, no electrical current should be flowing in the ground wire. However, if there is an electrical fault that makes the casing of the device electrically live, then some of that fault current will be carried away in the ground wire. The GFCI detects that anomalous current flow, and in response, the GFCI automatically interrupts the electrical supply to the device, deactivating the electrical socket and producing the same effect as if the malfunctioning device were suddenly unplugged. The GFCI also displays a warning light on the socket (shown red in <strong><a href="#ff44-2">Figure 44.2</a></strong>), indicating that the safety provisions of the GFCI have been triggered and that power output from the socket has been disabled. The malfunctioning device is rendered electrically safe, in that it no longer has any electrical power flowing to it, but it is also rendered inactive.</p>
<p class="indent">In many regard, this is a significant improvement over the preceding scenario in <strong><a href="ch044-sec02.xhtml#ff44-1">Figure 44.1</a></strong>. A warning light on the GFCI indicates that an electrical fault has occurred. As soon as the fault occurs, the device is automatically rendered safe. If a person subsequently touches the device, no shock can occur. These outcomes are desirable, and hence, GFCIs are commonly used in domestic settings that are at higher risk for electrical shock, such as electrical outlets in bathrooms, in kitchens, and outdoors. However, there are some notable drawbacks. Firstly, once the GFCI is triggered, electrical power to the device is immediately interrupted. This may be dangerous if the device itself is necessary for life support: suddenly interrupting power to a cardiac bypass machine or a ventilator is immediately hazardous to the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">Secondly, the GFCI can only work if the ground wire is intact. If the ground wire is broken or the ground wire is not connected to the GFCI because of an intervening two-pin plug, the GFCI can never detect current flow on the ground wire. Its safety features are then made ineffective.</p>
<p class="indent">Thirdly, the GFCI relies on an active mechanical circuit breaker to interrupt electrical power to the device. If this mechanical circuit breaker were itself to fail or jam, then theoretically the GFCI might be unable to interrupt the electrical power to the device. For these reasons, GFCIs are not approved for electrical safety in all ORs. GFCIs may be installed for electrical safety only if the OR is certified as a dry location.<sup><a href="ch044-sec06.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> Since 2012, all new ORs are considered wet locations by default unless a specific risk assessment waiver has been performed.<sup><a href="ch044-sec06.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen766">B. Isolated Power Systems, Isolation Transformers, and the Line Isolation Monitor</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The limitations of the GFCI can be overcome by creating what is known as an <strong><em>isolated power system</em></strong>. The purpose of the design of an isolated power system is to create an electrical power supply that can tolerate an electrical fault to the casing of a device, while simultaneously:</p>
<ul class="u_bullb"><li><span>Raising an alarm that an electrical fault has occurred.</span></li>
<li><span>Allowing the malfunctioning device to continue to operate.</span></li>
<li><span>Preventing a risk of shock from the malfunctioning device to a person touching it.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent"><strong><a href="#ff44-3">Figure 44.3</a></strong> illustrates an electrical fault occurring in an isolated power system. The two important new components in this diagram are the isolation transformer and the line isolation monitor (LIM).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">An isolation transformer allows electrical power to be transmitted from one circuit to another without the existence of a direct electrical connection between them. In <strong><a href="#ff44-3">Figure 44.3</a></strong>, the standard grounded electrical power supply is connected to the primary coil of the isolation transformer. The primary coil consists of a single wire, wrapped in a spiral fashion around a ferromagnetic core. The current flowing in this wire causes a magnetic field to be created in the core, in the manner described earlier for an inductor. However, in this case, the ferromagnetic core is shaped like a loop (a square in this case), and the magnetic field is trapped within the body of this loop. A secondary coil is wrapped around the opposite side of the core. The magnetic field generated by the current in the primary coil circulates around within this ferromagnetic loop. As the magnetic field passes through the windings of the secondary coil, it induces an electrical current causing power to be transmitted from the primary to the secondary. In an isolation transformer, the number of windings in the primary and secondary coil are the same, so that the current flowing in the primary and secondary coil are the same. The purpose of an isolation transformer, therefore, is to convert electrical power into a magnetic field and then immediately convert it back again into electrical power. Although this may initially appear redundant, it produces two important effects:</p>
<ol class="u_num1">
<li><span>An electrical fault on one side of the transformer cannot spread over to the other side because the two coils of the transformer are physically separated and linked only by a magnetic field.</span></li>
<li><span>The isolation transformer transmits only the potential difference across the primary coil, not the absolute voltage. A potential difference of 120 V AC exists between the hot and neutral wires attached to the primary coil. The hot wire is at 120 V AC and the neutral wire is fixed at ground. The outputs from the secondary coil are called Line One and Line Two. Only a potential of 120 V AC exists between them. The absolute voltages of Line One and Line Two are unknown. They are now isolated.</span></li></ol>
<p class="indent">In a grounded power system, the voltage of the neutral wire is at 0&#x00A0;V, because it is directly coupled to the ground wire which is also fixed at 0&#x00A0;V. In <a id="page916"></a>an isolated power system, this is no longer true, and the absolute voltages of Line One and Line Two are uncertain. These lines are coupled to ground only by the presence of parasitic capacitances and leakage currents.</p>
<p class="indent">If a normal electrical device is plugged into Line One and Line Two, it will receive the same amount of electrical power as if it were plugged into a standard, grounded power supply. This is because it is the potential difference, not the absolute voltage, that drives the current and the delivery of electrical power. A potential difference of 120&#x00A0;V exists between Line One and Line Two.</p>
<p class="indent">Suppose that an electrical device with an internal fault is connected to this isolated power supply, as shown in <strong><a href="#ff44-3">Figure 44.3</a></strong>. The electrical paths through the ground wire and through the person touching the device provide an electrical connection from the isolated Line One to ground. Effectively, Line One now has <strong><em>become grounded</em></strong>, and its voltage has become fixed at 0&#x00A0;V. Line One is said to have <strong><em>lost isolation</em></strong>. Line Two will continue to have a potential difference of 120 V AC relative to Line One, so the device will continue to operate. However, because Line One has taken on the same voltage as ground, no current can flow through the person to the ground because there is no potential difference. No electrical shock is produced.</p>

<p class="video1" id="vid44-1"><strong>VIDEO 44.1</strong></p>
<p class="video2"><strong>Line Isolation Monitor</strong></p>
<p class="indent">The LIM monitors the electrical potentials and leakage currents that exist between Line One and Line Two and ground. The line isolation monitor is designed to alarm when the isolation of the electrical power system has degraded to the extent that an electrical shock of greater than 5&#x00A0;mA could be produced with the next electrical fault. As shown in <strong><a href="ch044-sec02.xhtml#tt44-1">Table 44.1</a></strong>, a shock current of 5&#x00A0;mA applied to the body is considered to be the threshold below which no physical harm can result. <strong><a href="#ff44-3">Figure 44.3</a></strong> shows that the LIM has detected a loss of isolation and has triggered a hazard alarm.</p>
<p class="indent">In summary, in an isolated power system, neither Line One nor Line Two are the hot or neutral wires. However, if a fault occurs such that Line One is brought into contact with a grounded object or person, then Line One will immediately become the neutral wire, having lost isolation and having become grounded. Line Two will in turn become the equivalent of the hot wire. No shock will occur and all equipment will continue to receive electrical power. An isolated power system can therefore accommodate one single electrical fault without producing a shock and without having to shut down potentially life-sustaining medical devices. Of course, once a fault has occurred and the isolated power system has become grounded, then it is only as safe as the standard, grounded power system as shown in <strong><a href="ch044-sec02.xhtml#ff44-1">Figures 44.1</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#ff44-2">44.2</a></strong>.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<p class="indent">If a LIM begins to alarm during a surgical case, the anesthesiologist should try to identify which device in the OR is faulty. The anesthesiologist should unplug electrical devices in turn until the alarm stops, thus identifying the device that contains the electrical fault. Once the offending device is disconnected and quarantined, the other devices can be progressively reconnected. If the source of the fault cannot be identified, or if the fault lies within an essential piece of equipment that cannot be disconnected, then it is acceptable to complete the surgical procedure with vigilance; the margin of safety provided by the isolated power system has been lost, and particularly, careful attention must be paid to the arrangement of electrical devices around the patient. It is an absolute contraindication to begin a surgical case in an OR with a known electrical fault.</p>
<a id="page917"></a>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">If the LIM alarms, all equipment plugged into that circuit will remain operative. However, if the faulty device causing the alarm is not identified and removed, the LIM will no longer provide protection against shock if a second defective piece of equipment is plugged into the circuit.</p>
