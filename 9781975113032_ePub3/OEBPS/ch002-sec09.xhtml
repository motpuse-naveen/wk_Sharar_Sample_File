<h4 class="h4" id="sec16">IX. Lung Volumes</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Lung volume varies by the size of the individual, and as such, normal values are generally based on height. Combinations of two or more lung volumes are known as <strong><em>capacities</em></strong> (<strong><a href="#ff2-11">Figure 2.11</a></strong>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen31">A. Functional Residual Capacity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The functional residual capacity (FRC) is the amount of air left in the lungs at the end of passive exhalation after a normal breath. It is the combination of the residual volume and expiratory reserve volume. One of its main purposes<a id="page29"></a> is to serve as an oxygen reservoir during periods of apnea. During apnea, there is still perfusion to the lungs. It is the stored oxygen within the FRC that is obtained by the pulmonary circulation. For this reason, arterial hypoxemia does not occur instantaneously during apnea but rather over a longer period. Reductions in FRC can result in a much shorter period to arterial hypoxemia during apnea.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Lung Volumes</strong></p>
<p class="indent">There are several reasons that FRC can be reduced. Conditions that affect the lung parenchyma directly are pulmonary edema, atelectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, and acute lung injury. Mechanical or functional causes include posture (erect to supine position decreases FRC by 10%), pregnancy, obesity (due to a decrease in chest wall compliance), and abdominal compartment syndrome. These conditions lead to cephalad displacement of abdominal contents. Ventilatory muscle weakness and pleural effusion are also functional causes of hypoxemia.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Arterial hypoxemia does not occur instantaneously during apnea because the capillary blood that continues to perfuse the alveoli extracts oxygen from within the FRC.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen32">B. Closing Capacity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Small distal airways with little or no cartilaginous support depend on traction from the elastic recoil of surrounding tissue to remain open. Along with this, small airway patency is dependent on lung volume. The lung volume at which these small airways begin to close is known as the <strong><em>closing capacity</em></strong>.</p>
<p class="indent">In young individuals, the FRC far exceeds the closing capacity. As one ages or with obesity, however, the closing capacity steadily increases until it equals or even surpasses that of the FRC. When the closing capacity is reached, alveoli in the affected portions of lung are perfused but not ventilated, which leads to intrapulmonary shunting. This intrapulmonary shunt in combination with a low oxygen reserve in the setting of a low FRC can lead to significant arterial hypoxemia.</p>
<a id="page30"></a>
<p class="indent">Unlike FRC, closing capacity is unrelated to posture; because of this, the relation of the FRC (which is affected by posture) to closing capacity can change with patient position. In older individuals, the FRC can exceed the closing capacity in the upright position and fall below it in the supine position. In elderly patients, the closing capacity may be greater than the FRC, even in the upright position.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen33">C. Vital Capacity</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Vital capacity</em></strong> is the maximum amount of air that can be expelled from the lungs after both a maximal inspiration and maximal expiration: tidal volume plus inspiratory reserve volume plus expiratory reserve volume. This value is important for determining the patient&#x2019;s ability to maintain bronchial hygiene by coughing, as explained in the next section on pulmonary function testing. It is dependent upon respiratory muscle function and chest wall compliance. Normal values for vital capacity are 60 to 70&#x00A0;mL/kg.<sup><a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib2">2</a>,<a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib13">13</a></sup></p>
