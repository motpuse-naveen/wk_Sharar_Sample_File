<h4 class="h4" id="sec138">V. Colloids, Crystalloid, and Hypertonic Solutions</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The ideal resuscitative fluid would have a similar composition to plasma, have predictable and reliable effects on circulating blood volume, be free of undesired side effects, be inexpensive, and lead to improvements in patient-centered outcomes (morbidity, mortality, or length of stay). However, as one might expect, such a fluid does not exist, thus, the ongoing controversy between crystalloid and colloid solutions. The most commonly used resuscitation fluids are isotonic salt solutions and colloids, whose compositions are listed in <strong><a href="ch023-sec03.xhtml#tt23-7">Table 23.7</a></strong>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen361">A. Physiology and Pharmacology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The efficacy of any intravenous fluid in expanding the plasma volume is dependent on the proportion of administered fluid that remains in the intravascular space. Traditionally, net transcapillary fluid flux within the ECF space&#x2014;from plasma to interstitial fluid&#x2014;is described by the <strong><em>Starling equation:</em></strong></p>
<p class="u_equation"><img src="images/490-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="nonindent">where <em>F</em> is the net fluid movement between compartments, <em>Kf</em> is a filtration coefficient, <em>Pc</em> is the capillary hydrostatic pressure, <em>Pt</em> is the tissue hydrostatic <a id="page491"></a>pressure, &#x03C3; is the reflection coefficient (a measure of leakiness to a particular substance), <em>&#x03C0;c</em> is the capillary oncotic pressure, and <em>&#x03C0;i</em> the interstitial oncotic pressure.</p>
<p class="indent">Based on the traditional Starling equation (described in detail in <a href="ch003.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>), fluid moves from the plasma to the interstitium at the arteriolar level driven by the dominant hydrostatic pressure gradient. On the venular side of the circulation, the colloid oncotic pressure within the vasculature promotes fluid reabsorption back into circulation (see <a href="ch003-sec10.xhtml#ff3-18">Figure 3.18</a>). In order to exploit these basic physiologic mechanisms, hypertonic salt and colloidal solutions were introduced into clinical practice.</p>
<p class="indent">However, in clinical practice, volume expansion as a result of administered intravenous resuscitative fluids cannot be reliably predicted by the traditional Starling equation. This is especially true in states of inflammation, physiologic stress, and shock, in which capillary permeability is altered. In these situations, intravascular fluid loss (including both crystalloid and colloid solutions) to the interstitium is greater than would be expected. This signals the emerging importance of multiple capillary components (eg, endothelial glycocalyx, capillary basement membrane, and extracellular matrix) in driving diffusion physiology, as well as highlights the importance of the lymphatic circulation in returning interstitial fluid to the intravascular compartment. Thus, the actual volume equivalence of colloids to crystalloids observed in clinical practice is actually closer to two to one rather than the predicted three or four to one.<sup><a href="ch023-sec07.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen362">B. Clinical Implications of Choosing Crystalloid or Colloid</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The debate over crystalloid and colloid fluid administration is long-standing, and an overwhelming number of studies in the literature have compared their benefits and liabilities. For example, crystalloid resuscitation is generally associated with greater weight gain, which itself is associated with various negative clinical outcomes. However, this association is not causation and the literature still lacks strong evidence supporting one fluid type over the other. Studies suggest, however, that there are subsets of patients in whom the use of albumin and synthetic colloids appears to confer a worse outcome. <strong><a href="#tt23-9">Table 23.9</a></strong> summarizes selected literature comparing clinical outcomes with colloid and crystalloid resuscitation. Additional characteristics should also factor into the decision. Crystalloids are inexpensive, nonallergenic, and do not inhibit coagulation. However, their administration results in tissue edema, leading to gut flora translocation, poor wound healing, impairment of alveolar gas exchange, limited intravascular volume expansion, and metabolic derangements. Conversely, colloids are expensive, allergenic, and linked to renal failure and coagulopathy, and their theoretic benefit of remaining in the intravascular space is not supported by evidence.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen363">C. Implications of Crystalloid and Colloid Solutions on Intracranial Pressure</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Based on the discussion above, it could be expected that colloid solutions increase <strong><em>intracranial pressure (ICP)</em></strong> less than crystalloid, thus improving outcomes in <strong><em>traumatic brain injury (TBI)</em></strong> patients. This theory, however, assumes ideal physiologic conditions in which the <strong><em>blood-brain barrier</em></strong> remains intact. Unfortunately, as demonstrated in the SAFE trial (<strong><a href="#tt23-9">Table 23.9</a></strong>), this theory does not hold true clinically, and TBI patients resuscitated with colloids demonstrated increased mortality. A subgroup analysis of the SAFE trial further indicated that albumin resuscitation in TBI patients is associated with<a id="page492"></a> significantly higher ICPs in the first week postinjury than for those receiving crystalloids. The mechanism is not fully elucidated, but it is thought to involve a disruption in the blood-brain barrier, resulting in colloid leaking into brain parenchyma and rebound intracranial hypertension. Thus, colloid administration should be avoided in patients with suspected or known TBI.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen364">D. Implications of Isotonic Fluid Choice</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The choice of isotonic fluid remains somewhat unclear. Normal saline has historically been the default fluid for volume resuscitation, although it is technically slightly hypertonic and hyperchloremic. It has long been observed that administration of 0.9% normal saline has been associated with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, the full mechanisms of which are still being elucidated.<sup><a href="ch023-sec07.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup> Given the deleterious effects observed from other types of acidosis, concern for harm from 0.9% normal saline administration has grown.</p>
<p class="indent">Other fluid solutions that more closely mimic the soluble component of plasma through the lowering of NaCl content and the addition of other physiologically important solutes, such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, and buffers, were developed. These are referred to as &#x201C;buffered&#x201D; or &#x201C;balanced&#x201D; solutions (eg, lactated Ringer&#x2019;s, Plasmalyte). Numerous studies have compared normal saline to buffered solutions to identify harm in the form of death, acute kidney injury, renal replacement therapy needs, coagulopathy, damage to other organs, and so on. A 2019 Cochrane Review of this topic in the setting of critically ill adults and children showed that compared to 0.9% saline, buffered isotonic solutions were associated with higher pH, higher bicarb, and lower chloride levels; However, in-hospital mortality and/or renal injury did not differ, with the caveat that evidence certainty was low.<sup><a href="ch023-sec07.xhtml#bib9">9</a></sup> This same review also reported insufficient evidence for differences in coagulopathy, transfusion requirements, or damage to other organs. Despite this lack of evidence of harm, it is the opinion of the authors that differing clinical scenarios may dictate that one fluid type is more appropriate. For example, in patients with TBI and elevated ICP, the lower sodium content of buffered solutions may not be desired. In contrast, in patients with hyperchloremia and acidosis a buffered solution may be beneficial. However, for the many patients without specific indication for one fluid type over the other, there is likely to be ongoing debate and controversy until more definitive research is available.</p>

<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Hypertonic crystalloids can be administered in smaller volumes than isotonic crystalloids to achieve the same effect in intravascular fluid expansion, making hypertonic solutions attractive for use in low-resource settings such as military combat care.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen365">E. Clinical Implications of Hypertonic Fluid Administration</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hypertonic fluids commonly used in clinical practice include hypertonic saline and mannitol. Hypertonic saline is most commonly used to treat symptomatic hyponatremia, whereas hypertonic mannitol is used primarily to reduce increased ICP. Theoretically, administration of a hypertonic fluid creates a large osmotic gradient between ECF and ICF, drawing interstitial fluid into the intravascular space. The rapid increase in intravascular volume is the rationale behind giving hypertonic salt solutions for volume resuscitation. Initial successful studies of low-volume, hypertonic saline resuscitation in hemorrhagic shock were conducted in military environments where medical supply weight is of significant importance. Subsequent trials in civilian settings comparing hypertonic saline to isotonic fluid for resuscitation in trauma patients are sparse in number but have failed to show significant clinical improvement and, in fact, may worsen outcomes.</p>
<p class="indent">Hypertonic mannitol is used as a temporizing measure to decrease ICP until the primary pathology can be addressed. Mannitol remains intravascular and rapidly decreases ICP by drawing fluid into the intravascular space from brain interstitium and parenchyma. Additionally, mannitol inhibits reabsorption of free water and sodium in the kidneys, resulting in a rapid and large volume diuresis. However, a recent meta-analysis reviewing the studies comparing hypertonic saline and mannitol for treatment of elevated ICP concludes that <a id="page494"></a>hypertonic saline may be superior.<sup><a href="ch023-sec07.xhtml#bib10">10</a></sup> Unfortunately, only limited trials exist assessing long-term neurologic outcomes and adverse events associated with hypertonic saline administration, warranting further investigation.</p>
