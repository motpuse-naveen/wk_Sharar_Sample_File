<h4 class="h4" id="sec198">V. Fetal Assessment and Neonatal Resuscitation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring during labor attempts to identify fetal hypoxemia or acidosis and avoid resultant fetal neurologic damage or death. FHR monitoring can be intermittent, via auscultation or Doppler, or continuous, via external Doppler or fetal electrocardiogram (ECG). Fetal ECG requires internal monitor placement on the fetal scalp. The mother must be dilated and ruptured for this to occur. Continuous FHR monitoring is recommended by major obstetric organizations and accompanies almost 90% of US deliveries.<sup><a href="ch031-sec09.xhtml#bib12">12</a></sup> Despite the emphasis on FHR patterns and neonatal neurologic outcome, cerebral palsy is most often due to an antepartum, not intrapartum, event. Continuous FHR monitoring is associated retrospectively with lower rates of cerebral palsy and death. However, no randomized prospective data are available due to ethical issues. Intermittent versus continuous fetal monitoring has been compared prospectively, and the only difference in outcome is a higher rate of cesarean delivery <strong><em>without benefit to the neonate</em></strong>, and in general a lower risk of neonatal seizures.<sup><a href="ch031-sec09.xhtml#bib13">13</a></sup></p>

<p class="indent">FHR tracing interpretation is very sensitive but not very specific. Therefore, a normal FHR and variability without decelerations almost always indicates a nonacidotic fetus, but a healthy fetus may have FHR abnormalities not caused by acidosis or distress. Fetal tachycardia may be due to hypoxemia, but it may also result from maternal fever or infection or maternally administered drugs (&#x03B2; agonists in particular). Many maternally administered drugs, including magnesium and opioids, may decrease FHR variability (<strong><a href="#ff31-7">Figure 31.7</a></strong>).</p>

<p class="indent">The American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) classifies FHR tracings into three categories.<sup><a href="ch031-sec09.xhtml#bib10">10</a></sup> A Category I tracing is highly predictive of a healthy nonacidotic fetus and must have the following characteristics: normal baseline heart rate, normal variability, and no decelerations other than early. A Category III designation is associated with fetal acidosis and has the following characteristics: absent variability <strong><em>accompanied by</em></strong> late or variable decelerations occurring with &#x003E;50% of contractions or sinusoidal pattern. Category II includes any tracing not meeting the qualifiers of Category I or III (<strong><a href="#ff31-8">Figure 31.8</a></strong>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen520">A. Intrauterine Resuscitation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fetuses with Category III tracings or with prolonged bradycardia require rapid treatment. Treatment of maternal hypotension with lateral positioning, fluid bolus, and vasopressors; administration of high-flow oxygen via face mask; and cessation of uterine contractions with nitroglycerin or terbutaline are primary therapies. If no improvement is seen, immediate delivery is indicated.</p>
<p class="indent">Prolonged <strong><em>fetal bradycardia</em></strong> will lead to emergency cesarean delivery if intrauterine resuscitation measures are ineffective. An existing epidural catheter can be dosed with 20&#x00A0;mL of 3% chloroprocaine, which should provide a surgical level within 3 to 4 minutes. General anesthesia is usually chosen if fetal bradycardia persists in the operating room and no neuraxial catheter is present.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen521">B. Ancillary Fetal Testing</h5>
<p class="nonindent">High-risk fetuses or pregnancies sometimes require closer monitoring or additional testing to assess fetal status. A nonstress test (NST) consists of 30 minutes of continuous external FHR monitoring, during which time at least two accelerations of at least 15 beats per minute lasting 15 seconds or more must be seen, indicating a healthy fetus. NSTs are done weekly or daily depending on the diagnosis.</p>
<p class="indent">A biophysical profile further assesses fetal status. It has five components each with a maximum of two points, including an NST, measurement of amniotic fluid index, fetal tone, fetal movement, and fetal breathing attempts. Lower scores are indications for admission and continuous monitoring and sometimes delivery.</p>

<p class="indent">Umbilical artery Doppler studies are performed in fetuses with growth restriction or in mothers with hypertension or placental abnormalities to monitor for signs of worsening fetal perfusion (indicated by poor flow in diastole or elevation in placental resistance). The ratio of flow in systole versus diastole is measured, and a score over 3 is concerning. The resistance index is also measured, and a score of &#x003E;0.6 is indicative of elevated placental resistance. Absent end diastolic flow (AEDF) occurs when flow in diastole stops due to increased placental resistance. Reverse end diastolic flow (REDF) occurs when flow in diastole moves from the placenta to the fetus in the umbilical artery, indicating very elevated placental resistance. REDF is always an indication for delivery. AEDF is an indication for delivery depending on gestational age and other factors. Both are associated with increased fetal morbidity and mortality.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><em>Apgar score</em></strong> is a global assessment of neonatal status immediately after birth. The score&#x2019;s intended use is to guide acute intervention, not to provide prognosis. Neonatal breathing, heart rate, reaction to stimulus, tone, and color are each assessed at 1, 5, and sometimes 10 minutes postnatal and given a score of 0 to 2 per category. A score of &#x2265;7 is considered normal. Scores &#x003C;7 necessitate further intervention (<strong><a href="#tt31-4">Table 31.4</a></strong>; <strong><a href="ch031-sec06.xhtml#ff31-9">Figure 31.9</a></strong>).</p>
