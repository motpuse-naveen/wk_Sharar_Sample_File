<h4 class="h4" id="sec252">II. Postoperative Pain Management</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Uncontrolled postoperative pain can lead to excessive catecholamine release, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, splinting and impaired respiratory mechanics, and worsened patient experience. For these reasons, it is important to identify and treat postoperative pain appropriately in the PACU.<sup><a href="ch040-sec16.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup> Different methods for quantifying postoperative pain include verbal rating scales, numerical rating scales, visual analogue scales, and the Wong Baker faces scale. While traditionally managed with primarily IV opioids, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols and the growing opioid epidemic have emphasized the need for multimodal approaches. These include several classes of adjunctive analgesic medications (<strong><a href="#tt40-2">Table 40.2</a></strong>) as well as regional anesthesia.</p>
<p class="indent">ERAS protocols are multimodal care pathways that are implemented in the perioperative period that lead to earlier postoperative recovery, shorter<a id="page836"></a> hospital length of stay, and improved patient outcomes.<sup><a href="ch040-sec16.xhtml#bib3">3</a>,<a href="ch040-sec16.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> While these protocols were initially validated in colorectal surgeries, their scope of implementation has subsequently expanded to include many other types of surgeries, and this trend will likely continue. ERAS protocols encompass the entire perioperative period, and it is important that care of patients in the PACU be consistent with the goals of these protocols when appropriate.</p>

<p class="indent">A primary component of ERAS pathways is a multimodal approach to analgesia, geared primarily toward reducing the use of opioids, particularly long-acting ones. Preoperatively, patients may receive several analgesic medications that are intended to improve pain control while also minimizing the use of opioids. These medications include acetaminophen, neuropathic medications like gabapentin or pregabalin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or selective COX-2 inhibitors (<strong><a href="#ff40-1">Figure 40.1</a></strong>). It is important to be aware of the preoperative or intraoperative administration of these medications while taking care of patients in the PACU in order to maintain the appropriate dosing schedules and to avoid potential toxicities related to administration of multiple medications from one class. Additionally, neuropathic<a id="page837"></a> medications like gabapentin and pregabalin have been linked to somnolence and respiratory depression, especially when combined with other central nervous system (CNS) depressant medications, which are inevitably present in the perioperative setting. It is important to keep these medications in mind when evaluating patients that are slow to arouse or showing signs of depressed respiratory drive.</p>

<p class="indent">The use of regional anesthesia, when feasible, is an equally important component of pain management in ERAS protocols, as these techniques also minimize opioid use. Interventions in the PACU may include optimizing existing epidural or nerve block catheters for patients that had them placed pre- or intraoperatively. Patients with unexpectedly high analgesic requirements may benefit from postoperative nerve blocks or continuous nerve block catheter placement when appropriate. With the expanded use of long-acting liposomal bupivacaine, it is important to determine which patients can safely receive additional doses of local anesthetics without significant risk for local anesthetic systemic toxicity.</p>
