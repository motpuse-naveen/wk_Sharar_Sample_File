<p class="nonindent">Pain after laparoscopic procedures is <strong><em>far less</em></strong> than after comparable procedures performed through open laparotomy. However, the insertion sites of the instruments are painful, and CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation and residual pneumoperitoneum often cause diaphragmatic irritation, leading to referred pain to the shoulder.<sup><a href="ch027-sec08.xhtml#bib12">12</a></sup> Local anesthetic infiltration is beneficial at the insertion sites and has very few potential complications. Narcotic doses can be limited if they are combined with other analgesics including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Prior to administering an NSAID, the surgical team should be consulted to confirm there is no unreasonable risk of bleeding from the NSAID&#x2019;s antiplatelet effect. Rarely would more invasive pain therapy such as regional block be required for adequate pain relief except in patients with chronic pain problems or chronic narcotic use.</p>
