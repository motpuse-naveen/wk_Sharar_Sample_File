<h4 class="h4" id="sec283">I. Principles of Electricity</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen759">A. Introduction</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Electrical current is measured in amperes with the symbol <em>I</em>. When an electrical potential exists, current will flow through an electrically conductive substance, which is known as a conductor. The electrical potential is measured in volts, symbolized by <em>E</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">This concept can be highlighted by considering a person standing on solid ground while touching a live electrical wire. The ground is considered to be at 0&#x00A0;V, and the wire is a live domestic electrical wire at 120&#x00A0;V. The person would receive an electrical shock due to the difference in voltage between the wire and the ground. However, if the same individual were standing on a metal plate that had a matching voltage of 120&#x00A0;V while touching the same wire, no shock would be delivered because there would be no difference in voltages.</p>
<p class="indent">It is the difference in electrical potential (called the potential difference) that generates the current and the delivery of energy, not the absolute voltage. Imagine two patients falling from their beds. Patient A is on the sixth floor of the hospital, and his bed is 20&#x00A0;m above ground level. Patient B is on the third floor, and his bed is 10&#x00A0;m above ground level. Of course, it is not their absolute height in the building (ie, absolute voltage) that matters, but instead, the height of the fall from their beds to the floor of their rooms (ie, potential difference).</p>
<p class="indent">Conductors have a property called resistance (<em>R</em>, measured in ohms), which is defined as the tendency to resist the flow of a current for a given potential difference. Potential difference, current, and resistance are related by Ohm law:</p>

<p class="nonindent">The electrical resistance of the human body is not constant. It is strongly dependent on the wetness of the skin. Wet skin can generate a resistance of approximately 1000&#x00A0;&#x03A9;, whereas dry skin can generate a resistance of up to 100,000&#x00A0;&#x03A9;.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen760">B. Direct and Alternating Current</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The current flow in a circuit may be either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). This depends on whether the direction in which the electrical current flows in the circuit remains the same (DC), or alternates back and forth (AC). Batteries produce a direct current. The positive terminal of the battery remains at a constant higher electrical potential relative to the negative terminal of the battery until the battery is exhausted. Therefore, the current always flows from the positive to the negative terminal.</p>
<p class="indent">The electrical current obtained from the mains power supply is alternating current. The potential difference of the live conductor oscillates around the neutral conductor. It is possible to convert AC to DC using a simple circuit called a <strong><em>rectifier</em></strong>, and AC voltages are specified in terms of the equivalent DC voltage that would make the same amount of electrical power available. The mains power supply in the United States, which is nominally 120&#x00A0;V, has a live conductor whose potential difference oscillates sinusoidally between &#x00B1;170&#x00A0;V relative to the neutral conductor sixty times each second.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen761">C. Capacitors and Inductors, Reactance and Impedance</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Capacitors and inductors are both devices capable of storing electrical energy.<sup><a href="ch044-sec06.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> A capacitor consists of two electrical plates, separated by an insulating material called the <strong><em>dielectric</em></strong>. As a DC voltage is applied to the capacitor, positive <a id="page910"></a>charge begins to accumulate on one plate of the capacitor, while negative charge begins to build up on the opposite plate. Eventually, a sufficient charge accumulates such that an equilibrium state is produced, in which no further current can flow. The capacitor can be rapidly discharged from this state, producing a pulse of current through the desired part of the circuit&#x2014;this is similar to how a camera flash operates. Once the capacitor is fully charged, however, no additional electrical current can flow onto it, and its resistance to DC becomes effectively infinite.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">It is possible for electricity to be transmitted from one circuit to another without direct contact. This is an important part of the isolation transformer in use in most ORs.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">An inductor consists of a coil of wire wrapped in a spiral fashion around a ferromagnetic core. As electrical current passes through the coil of wire, an equal and opposing magnetic field is created in the core, and an opposing electrical voltage occurs in the coil. In this regard, an inductor is similar to a simple electromagnet. However, once the current to the inductor is interrupted, the magnetic field in the core collapses, inducing a strong, opposing voltage spike in the electrical coil. Thus, these devices can not only store charge but can also cause electrical and magnetic fields that exist beyond the physical boundaries of the device itself.</p>
<p class="indent">When alternating current is applied to a capacitor, the voltage on the plates of the capacitor switches polarity as the AC voltage cycles. This causes electrical charge, in the form of electrical current, to flow on and off the plates of the capacitor. Therefore, even though there is no direct electrical connection between the two plates of the capacitor, and even though the effective electrical resistance to DC is infinite, the act of repeatedly charging and discharging the capacitor allows alternating current to be able to flow through it. This &#x201C;resistance&#x201D; to alternating current is called <strong><em>reactance</em></strong>; it is a property of both capacitors and inductors and is dependent on the frequency of the alternating current. The simple and familiar expression of Ohm law above, in which resistance is expressed as <em>R</em>, is only true for direct current. In order to model alternating current at different frequencies, a quantity called <strong><em>impedance</em></strong> becomes important. Impedance represents a combination of both resistance and reactance.</p>
<p class="indent">More precisely, impedance is a complex number whose real component is the electrical resistance and whose imaginary component is the reactance. From a practical standpoint, the existence of reactance makes it possible to design circuits that only allow electrical signals at certain frequencies to pass through them. This is the basis of graphic equalizers for music. It is also the basis for medical signal filters for electrocardiograms (ECGs) that filter and amplify only those frequencies associated with cardiac conduction and reject signals at frequencies that are associated with interference.</p>
<p class="indent">By carefully arranging capacitors and inductors, it is possible to design circuits that can receive and respond to external electromagnetic signals, and to design circuits that optimally radiate electromagnetic energy out into the environment. Such circuits form the basis of radios and broadcast towers. However, these properties can also exist in an unwanted form in electrical devices. The proximity of electrical conductors within the power cord of a device or between the windings of an electric motor and its metal case can cause <strong><em>stray capacitance or parasitic capacitance</em>.</strong> In turn, these produce the phenomena of <strong><em>electrical interference</em></strong> and <strong><em>leakage current</em></strong>.</p>
