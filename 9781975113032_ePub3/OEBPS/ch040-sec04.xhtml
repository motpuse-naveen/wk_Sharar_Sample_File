<p class="nonindent">Multiple conditions can lead to postoperative changes in mental state. Those most commonly encountered in the PACU include residual anesthetic, opioid side effect, hypoxia, hypercapnia, and hypoglycemia. The patient with<a id="page839"></a> significantly depressed mental status should be assessed for airway patency and respiratory function, and consideration should be given to reversal agents such as naloxone and flumazenil. A fingerstick glucose should be checked with initial assessment, and further workup such as electrolytes and arterial blood gas (ABG) should be considered.</p>
<p class="indent">On the other end of the spectrum, confusion and agitation are also commonly encountered in the PACU, especially in the pediatric and geriatric populations. Antipsychotics and dexmedetomidine may be considered for management of extreme cases once other etiologies have been ruled out such as pain, full bladder, or respiratory distress.</p>
