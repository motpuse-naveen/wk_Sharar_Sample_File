<h5 class="h5" id="sen71">A. Anatomy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The kidneys are paired retroperitoneal organs that lie at the T12 to L4 vertebral levels (<strong><a href="#ff5-1">Figure 5.1</a></strong>). The kidneys receive about 20% to 25% of the cardiac output. Blood supply is via a single renal artery to each side. The renal veins receive venous drainage from the kidneys as well as from the suprarenal glands, gonads, diaphragm, and body wall. Lymphatic drainage is to the lumbar nodes. Sympathetic innervation to the kidney arises from the celiac and intermesenteric plexuses and travels with the renal arteries. Parasympathetic innervation to the kidneys is via the vagus nerve and to the ureters is via the splanchnic nerves. Renal pain sensation travels back to spinal segments T10 to L1 via sympathetic fibers.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The kidneys receive the largest percentage of core organ cardiac output and account for about 7% of total body oxygen consumption, although their combined weight is only about 0.5% of total body weight.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">With the exception of the hilum, the renal parenchyma is enclosed by a tough but thin fibrous membrane and is divided into two distinct regions: the cortex and the medulla (<strong><a href="#ff5-1">Figure 5.1</a></strong>). The <strong><em>cortex</em></strong> is the outer portion of the kidney and contains alternating bands of cortical labyrinth (glomeruli and convoluted tubules) and parallel arrays of straight tubules (medullary rays). The <strong><em>medulla</em></strong> is the deeper part of the parenchyma and is divided into an outer region, which contains the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, and an inner region, which does not. The outer region of the medulla is itself divided into outer and inner stripes, which are defined by the presence (outer) or absence (inner) of proximal tubules (<strong><a href="#ff5-1">Figure 5.1</a></strong>). Tubules in the medulla are arranged into pyramids, which are oriented with the base toward the cortex and the tip (papilla) toward a minor calyx to where urine drains.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The renal medulla is the part of the kidney most vulnerable to hypoxia because it contains the thick ascending loops of Henle, which have high metabolic activity.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen72">B. Physiology: Correlation of Structure and Function</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>The Nephron</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong><em>nephron</em></strong> is the structural and functional unit of the kidney and is responsible for urine formation. There are about 1.2 million nephrons in the kidney. Nephrons play a dominant role in water and electrolyte homeostasis, acid-base balance, and blood pressure control. Each nephron comprises a glomerulus and a tubule (<strong><a href="#ff5-2">Figure 5.2</a></strong>). The <strong><em>glomerulus</em></strong> is a capillary tuft encased in a fibrous structure called Bowman capsule, together known as the <strong><em>renal corpuscle.</em></strong> This is where blood filtration occurs. Absorption and secretion occur in the renal tubules, which are divided into three main segments&#x2014;the proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, and distal convoluted tubule. Filtrate from each nephron drains into the collecting system and passes through the papillary ducts toward the renal calyces.</p>

Wolters Kluwer; 2019:323-338, Figures 25.2 and 25.3.)</figcaption></figure></div>
<h6 class="h6">The Glomerulus</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Each nephron is associated with a glomerulus, which is a tuft of capillaries supplied by an afferent arteriole and drained by an efferent arteriole. Glomeruli are divided into two subtypes: <strong><em>superficial glomeruli</em></strong> (80%-85% of glomeruli; located near the renal capsule and associated with short loops of Henle) and <strong><em>juxtamedullary glomeruli</em></strong> (15%-20% of glomeruli, which have long loops of Henle extending deep into the medulla) (<strong><a href="#ff5-3">Figure 5.3</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Podocytes</em></strong> are specialized epithelial cells that cover the outside of the glomerular capillary and have extensions called foot processes. Between the foot processes are slit diaphragm. The glomerular filtration barrier is composed of three layers: the endothelium, basement membrane, and foot processes of the podocytes. This complex provides for selective permeability. Normally, selective permeability permits only about 25% of plasma elements to pass into Bowman capsule; proteins larger than &#x223C;65&#x00A0;kDa are unable to cross. However, in certain disease states, including nephrotic syndrome and glomerulonephritis, large proteins and/or red blood cells are able to penetrate Bowman capsule.</p>
<h6 class="h6">The Juxtaglomerular Apparatus</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The juxtaglomerular apparatus is located at the end of the distal tubule and comprises afferent and efferent arterioles, the mesangium, and the macula densa (<strong><a href="#ff5-4">Figure 5.4</a></strong>). The mesangium consists of an extracellular matrix and specialized cells called mesangial cells. The macula densa is a region of the specialized, distal, thick ascending limb of the <strong><em>loop of Henle</em></strong> of the parent nephron. It is formed from low columnar cells that have their apical membranes exposed to the tubular fluid and the basilar aspect in contact with cells of the mesangium and the afferent arteriole. Gap junctions exist between the<a id="page91"></a> mesangial cells, serving as a functional link between the macula densa, glomerular arterioles, and mesangium. The juxtaglomerular apparatus plays a key role in blood pressure regulation.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Proximal Tubule and Loop of Henle</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The cellular structure of the <strong><em>proximal tubule</em></strong> is highly specialized, reflecting the high energy demands required for a range of complex transport functions. Virtually no active transport occurs in the descending part of the loop of Henle (<strong><a href="#ff5-4">Figure 5.4</a></strong>). Rather, urine concentration occurs in this part of the loop through passive urea transporters and simple water channels. The thick ascending limb is where sodium and potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase)&#x2013;driven active transport resorbs sodium and chloride. The macula densa is the modified part of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, which forms part of the juxtaglomerular apparatus.<sup><a href="ch005-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">IgA nephropathy (also called Berger syndrome) is the most common cause of primary glomerulonephritis in developed countries. It is characterized by the presence of IgA antibodies to components of the renal mesangium.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">The Distal Tubule</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong><em>distal tubule</em></strong> is composed of the distal convoluted tubule, the connecting tubule, and the initial collecting duct (<strong><a href="#ff5-3">Figure 5.3</a></strong>). The cells of the distal convoluted tubule actively transport sodium and have calcium ATPase, which is important in the reabsorption of divalent cations. The connecting tubules lie<a id="page92"></a> within the cortical labyrinth, where several tubules join together to form the collecting duct. Cells of the connecting tubule are similarly involved in sodium and cation transport but, unlike the distal convoluted tubule cells, they have water channels.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff5-3"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff5-3.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="caption"><span class="fignum">Figure&#160;5.3</span> Nephron types and the collecting duct system. (From Filtration and micturition. In: Preston RR, Wilson TE, eds. <em>Lippincott <sup>&#x00AE;</sup> Illustrated Reviews: Physiology</em>. 2nd ed. Wolters Kluwer; 2019:323-338, Figures 25.5.)</figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen73">C. Glomerular Filtration Rate</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the volume of filtrate formed by both kidneys per minute. This is approximately 125&#x00A0;mL/min in an average patient with normal renal function. Fluid and solutes are forced under pressure from the glomerulus (afferent arteriole) into the capsular space of the renal corpuscle. A filtration membrane allows for passage into the capsular space of fluid and small solutes based on their physical size and charge. Filtration occurs by bulk flow driven by the hydrostatic pressure of the blood; small molecules pass rapidly through the filtration membrane, while larger molecules are retained within the arteriole. The relatively large diameter of the afferent arterioles and small diameter of the efferent arterioles result in a high capillary pressure (&#x223C;60&#x00A0;mm Hg). This driving pressure is opposed by capsular hydrostatic pressure (&#x223C;15&#x00A0;mm Hg) and colloid osmotic pressure with the glomerular capillaries (&#x223C;32&#x00A0;mm Hg). Although the concentration of small solutes is the same across the filtration membrane, large proteins are retained and the osmotic pressure of the blood increases as the fluid moves out of the glomerulus. This results in a net filtration pressure of approximately 10 to 15&#x00A0;mm Hg. There is a direct relationship between the net filtration pressure and the GFR. If either the hydrostatic or osmotic pressure of the glomerular capillaries or the hydrostatic pressure of the capsular space changes, the GFR will also change.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Tubular filtration reduces about 180&#x00A0;L of fluid each day to about 1&#x00A0;L/d of fluid that is excreted as urine.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen74">D. Autoregulation of Renal Blood Flow and Glomerular Filtration</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Autoregulation of renal blood flow and GFR are intimately related. In healthy individuals, renal blood flow is maintained nearly constant with changes in<a id="page93"></a> systolic blood pressure from about 80 to 200&#x00A0;mm Hg (<strong><a href="#ff5-5">Figure 5.5</a></strong>). There are three main mechanisms whereby renal blood flow (and thus GFR) is regulated: myogenic response, tubuloglomerular feedback, and sympathetic nervous system stimulation.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff5-4"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff5-4.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="caption"><span class="fignum">Figure&#160;5.4</span> Juxtaglomerular apparatus. (From Filtration and micturition. In: Preston RR, Wilson TE, eds. <em>Lippincott <sup>&#x00AE;</sup> Illustrated Reviews: Physiology</em>. 2nd ed. Wolters Kluwer; 2019:323-338, Figures 25.10.)</figcaption></figure></div>
<h6 class="h6">Myogenic Response</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The myogenic response is an intrinsic property of vascular smooth muscle, whereby arterioles constrict in response to increased transmural pressure and relax in response to decreased transmural pressure. This allows for relatively constant blood flow and GFR over a wide range of pressures.<sup><a href="ch005-sec05.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup></p>
<a id="page94"></a>
<div class="figure" id="ff5-5"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff5-5.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="caption"><span class="fignum">Figure&#160;5.5</span> Autoregulation of renal blood flow. (From Filtration and micturition. In: Preston RR, Wilson, TE, eds. <em>Lippincott <sup>&#x00AE;</sup> Illustrated Reviews: Physiology</em>. 2nd ed. Wolters Kluwer; 2019:323-338, Figures 25.9.)</figcaption></figure></div>
<h6 class="h6">Tubuloglomerular Feedback</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism occurs via the cells of the macula densa. By virtue of its proximity to the afferent arteriole (<strong><a href="#ff5-4">Figure 5.4</a></strong>), the macula densa is perfectly positioned to create a feedback loop controlling blood flow through the glomerulus. If the myogenic response does not fully regulate blood flow through the glomerulus, increased capillary pressure results in an increase in the GFR. The increased delivery of sodium chloride in the tubular fluid reaching the macula densa in the distal tubule results in vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole (tubuloglomerular feedback). Increased sodium transport in the distal tubule is not the only mechanism triggering tubuloglomerular feedback. Tubular fluid flow, independent of sodium concentration, is sensed by primary cilia located on the apical (luminal) aspect of the macula densa cells and also trigger tubuloglomerular feedback.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sympathetic Nervous System</h6>
<p class="nonindent">During periods of stress, such as hypotension or hemorrhage, sympathetic stimulation overrides autoregulation. Increased renal sympathetic activity decreases sodium and water excretion by (1) increasing tubular water and sodium reabsorption throughout the nephron; (2) decreasing renal blood flow and GFR by vasoconstriction of the arterioles; and (3) increasing activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) by releasing renin from the juxtaglomerular granular cells.<sup><a href="ch005-sec05.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup></p>
<a id="page95"></a>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen75">E. Tubular Reabsorption of Sodium and Water</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Sodium moves freely from the glomerulus across the filtration membrane into Bowman capsule and has the same concentration in the tubular fluid as it has in the plasma. Approximately two-thirds of the filtrate reaching the proximal tubule is reabsorbed. This process is regulated both acutely and chronically by blood pressure, extracellular fluid volume, the RAAS, the sympathetic nervous system, and an intrarenal dopamine natriuretic system.<sup><a href="ch005-sec05.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> The bulk of sodium chloride, bicarbonate, phosphate, glucose, water, and other substrates is reabsorbed into the tubular cells as they move <strong><em>passively</em></strong> down their concentration gradients (<strong><a href="#ff5-5">Figures 5.5</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#ff5-6">5.6</a></strong>). Sodium-potassium ATPase in the basolateral membrane then <strong><em>actively</em></strong> pumps sodium out of the cell into the interstitial fluid, maintaining a low intracellular concentration. This maintains the driving force for sodium entry from the tubular fluid at the luminal side. The <strong><em>colloid oncotic pressure</em></strong> in the capillaries accompanying the proximal tubules is high because large molecules are retained by the filtration membrane of Bowman capsule. Sodium and water are reabsorbed from the interstitial fluid into the capillaries by bulk flow mediated by both hydrostatic and osmotic forces. The fraction of sodium reabsorbed in the proximal tubule varies according to prevailing conditions (<strong><a href="#tt5-1">Table 5.1</a></strong>). Water reabsorption occurs passively in the proximal tubule by osmosis and is coupled with sodium transport through the cells. Water also passes through the tight junctions between cells, which allows for diffusion of water and small ions.</p>
<p class="indent">The loop of Henle has three distinct regions: the thin descending segment, the thin ascending segment, and the thick ascending segment. The thin segments have thin membranes with no brush borders and few mitochondria (<strong>Figure&#x00A0;5.3</strong>) because of low metabolic requirements. There is little active reabsorption of water or solutes within these segments. However, the thin descending segment is highly permeable to water, but not to solutes. Therefore, as water diffuses passively out of the cells, the osmolarity of the tubular fluid increases to a maximum at the very tip of the loop of Henle. In contrast, both the thin and thick parts of the ascending limb are impermeable to water (<strong><a href="#ff5-5">Figures 5.5</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#ff5-6">5.6</a></strong>). Sodium moves into the cell along its gradient, which is maintained by basolateral Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase. At the same time, sodium cotransports potassium into the cell against its gradient.</p>
<p class="indent">The remainder of the <strong><em>distal nephron</em></strong> includes the connecting tubule and collecting duct (<strong><a href="#ff5-2">Figures 5.2</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#ff5-3">5.3</a></strong>). Only a small percentage of the original filtrate reaches these segments, but the reabsorption of water and solutes is highly regulated here and accounts for the fine tuning of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis by the kidney. There are distinct cell populations in the distal nephron. The connecting tubule consists of connecting cells and intercalated cells, while the collecting duct consists of principal cells and intercalated cells. Sodium reabsorption in the connecting tubule and collecting duct is mediated by the connecting cells and principal cells via hormone-sensitive (aldosterone) apical epithelial sodium channels.</p>
<p class="indent">Aldosterone forms a complex with receptors on the cell member of principal cells to promote the formation of sodium channels and enhances the activity of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pumps. The <strong><em>intercalated cells</em></strong> are of two types: type A, which secrete protons and reabsorb potassium, and type B, which secrete bicarbonate and reabsorb chloride. Water reabsorption, which occurs to a much greater extent in the collecting duct than the connecting tubule, is under the influence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH; aka arginine vasopressin). ADH is produced in the posterior pituitary gland and released in response to hypovolemia and (to a less extent) hyperosmolality. ADH causes vasoconstriction in the kidney, especially of the efferent arteriole, which preserves glomerular filtration pressure even in the face of hypotension. ADH also binds to specific receptors on the medullary collecting ducts and enhances the expression of aquaporin channels on the principal cells, which increases water reabsorption. The collecting duct is normally relatively impermeable to water. However, it becomes highly permeable to water in the presence of ADH.</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen76">F. The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The RAAS is a complex hormonal system that regulates systemic blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte balance through local effects in the kidney and via systemic effects in other parts of the body. Renin is released by cells of the macula densa and collecting ducts in response to adrenergic stimulation, hypovolemia, or reduced perfusion. Renin converts <strong><em>angiotensinogen</em></strong> generated by the liver into <strong><em>angiotensin I (Ang I)</em></strong>. Ang I is further cleaved by <strong><em>angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)</em></strong> produced by the lungs to form the active hormone <strong><em>angiotensin II (Ang II)</em></strong> (<strong><a href="#ff5-7">Figure 5.7</a></strong>). Recent studies have demonstrated that there are several Ang II receptor subtypes. However, the angiotensin type-1 receptor is by far the most common; through this receptor, angiotensin produces profound vasoconstriction at the level of the efferent arteriole, as well as promotes tubular sodium reabsorption, and secretion of aldosterone, vasopressin, and endothelin. Ang II also produces systemic vasoconstriction, but with only about one-tenth the potency of its renal effect.</p>
<p class="indent">Aldosterone is produced in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in response to Ang II, adrenocorticotropic hormone, hyperkalemia, and hyponatremia. The net effect is increased sodium reabsorption. A feedback loops allows for precise control of the RAAS. Ang II feeds back to the juxtaglomerular apparatus to inhibit renin secretion from the macula densa and collecting duct cells. In addition, prostaglandins produced in the renal medulla are released in response to sympathetic nervous system stimulation and act to modulate the vasoconstrictive effects of the RAAS.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen77">G. Renal Vasodilator Response</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Exposure to stressors, of which surgery is one, results in the activation of <strong><em>vasopressor factors</em></strong> (RAAS, sympathetic discharge, vasopressin release), which maintain or increase systemic blood pressure but at the expense of renal circulation. The kidney is able to preserve its blood flow to some extent by the paracrine effects of several intrarenal vasodilators, including nitric oxide, prostaglandins, natriuretic peptides, and bradykinin (<strong><a href="#tt5-2">Table 5.2</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch005-sec05.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The proximal tubule also produces dopamine from L-dopa via the enzyme <small>L</small>-amino acid decarboxylase. Circulating and locally formed dopamine<a id="page98"></a> activates <strong><em>dopamine receptors</em></strong> on arterioles and tubules via adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, and phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>. Activation of dopamine receptors affects both sodium excretion and renal hemodynamics (<strong><a href="#tt5-3">Table 5.3</a></strong>). Sodium reabsorption is reduced in the proximal tubule, producing diuresis and natriuresis. Although dopamine is an effective diuretic, it has other effects on the cardiovascular system, which may include tachycardia and increased blood pressure even at so-called renal doses (1-3&#x00A0;&#x03BC;g/kg/min). Dopamine has not been shown to protect against or ameliorate either acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is no longer recommended in the management of either condition.<sup><a href="ch005-sec05.xhtml#bib6">6</a></sup> The selective dopamine 1<a id="page99"></a> agonist fenoldopam is also an efficient diuretic, and there are some data suggesting that it may be effective in preventing cardiac surgery&#x2013;associated AKI. It is, however, not in widespread use as a renoprotective agent and is only approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an antihypertensive in hypertensive crises.</p>
