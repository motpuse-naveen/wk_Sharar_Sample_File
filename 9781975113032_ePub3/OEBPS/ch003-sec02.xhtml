<h4 class="h4" id="sec22">II. The Cardiac Cycle</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong><em>cardiac cycle</em></strong> consists of an orchestrated sequence of spontaneous electrical and contractile events occurring simultaneously in both the right and left sides of the heart. When combined with the flow-directing influence of the four unidirectional heart valves, a sequential rise and fall of fluid pressures within each of the four heart chambers results in a predictable pattern of chamber volumes and pressures that produces forward cardiac output and accompanying heart sounds associated with valve closure.<sup><a href="ch003-sec10.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup> These synchronized electrical and mechanical events are depicted under normal anatomic and physiologic conditions in <strong><a href="#ff3-7">Figure 3.7</a></strong>. Anatomic or physiologic abnormalities in any of these components can alter events of the cardiac cycle and ultimately impact cardiac performance.</p>

<p class="indent">Focusing on the left heart, depolarization of the LV associated with the QRS complex of the electrocardiogram (ECG) initiates LV contraction and begins the period of <strong><em>systole</em></strong> with closure of the mitral valve contributing to the first heart sound (S<sub>1</sub>). During early systole, both the mitral and aortic valves are closed; the mitral valve due to the positive LV &#x2192; LA pressure gradient and papillary muscle contraction, and the aortic valve due to the positive aortic root &#x2192; LV pressure gradient. Because LV volume is fixed during early systole, LV contraction results in a brief, yet rapid isovolumic elevation in LV pressure. The maximum rate of rise in LV pressure (+dP/dt) occurs during this brief <strong><em>isovolumic contraction period</em></strong> and is commonly used as the index of LV contractility (as discussed later).</p>

Note the LV isovolumic contraction period (ICP) and the relaxation period (IRP) during which there is no change in LV volume because the aortic and mitral valves are closed. The LV decreases in volume as it ejects its contents into the aorta. During the first third of systolic ejection (the rapid ejection period), the curve of emptying is steep. ECG, electrocardiogram.

<p class="indent">Once the rapidly rising LV pressure exceeds aortic root pressure, the aortic valve passively opens and pulsatile aortic flow begins. Both the LV and aortic pressures continue to rise and then quickly peak and fall during the remainder of systole as ventricular contraction ceases and the LV repolarizes. The stroke volume ejected during systole is approximately two-thirds of the end-diastolic LV volume.</p>
<p class="indent">Systole ends when the slowly declining aortic root pressure exceeds the more rapidly falling LV pressure, resulting in passive closure of the aortic valve and its contribution to the second heart sound (S<sub>2</sub>). As <strong><em>diastole</em></strong> begins, both the mitral and aortic valves are briefly closed. During this short-lived, <strong><em>isovolumic relaxation period</em></strong>, LV pressure rapidly falls, while LA pressure slowly rises due to pulmonary inflow. When LA pressure exceeds LV pressure, the MV passively opens and diastolic filling of the LV begins. Diastole consists of four phases&#x2014;isovolumic relaxation, early diastolic filling, diastasis, and<a id="page49"></a> atrial systole (LA contraction)&#x2014;until the cardiac cycle is repeated with LV depolarization and contraction.</p>

<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">With spontaneous inspiration, venous return to the right ventricle is increased, resulting in prolonged ejection time compared with the left ventricle. This causes the pulmonic valve to close later than the aortic valve, producing respiration-induced variation in splitting of S<sub>2</sub> (physiologic splitting).</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Similar parallel events occur in the right heart during the cardiac cycle with corresponding chamber volumes (ie, right and left ventricular stroke volumes are equal under normal anatomic conditions) and tricuspid/pulmonic valve movements mirroring the mitral/aortic movements. As a result of peristaltic inflow, lesser cardiac muscle mass, and lesser contractile strength of the RV, there is no isovolumic contraction period in the RV. The RV and PA pressures are significantly lower than corresponding left-sided pressures. Right-sided systolic ejection time may exceed the left-sided time, resulting in later closure of the pulmonic valve (compared with the aortic valve) and a split S<sub>2</sub>. During spontaneous inspiration, <strong><em>venous return</em></strong> is increased to the right ventricle and decreased to the left ventricle, resulting in prolongation of the splitting of S<sub>2</sub>, referred to as <strong><em>physiologic splitting</em></strong>.</p>
