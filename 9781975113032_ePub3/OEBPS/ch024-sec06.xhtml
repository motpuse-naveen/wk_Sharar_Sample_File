<p class="nonindent"><strong><a href="#ff24-2">Figure 24.2</a></strong> shows the three general phases of platelet function: adherence, activation, and stabilization. When the blood vessel is injured, platelets adhere via surface receptors to underlying collagen and to von Willebrand factor (vWF) on endothelium or in a blood clot. These engaged receptors set off signaling pathways mediated via phospholipase C (PLC) to cause platelet activation. In the activation phase, platelets secrete numerous agents to<a id="page516"></a> stimulate other platelets, including calcium (Ca<sup>++</sup>), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and serotonin released from dense granules, and thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> produced from arachidonic acid via the cyclo-oxygenase pathway. The outer platelet membrane has receptors for these agonists, including the P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> receptor for ADP and for thrombin, setting off further internal signaling via PLC. Activated platelets also release &#x03B1;-granules containing activated factor V for the coagulation cascade, and they change shape from round to flat and spiky. Finally, in stabilization, PLC mediates &#x201C;inside-out&#x201D; signaling to activate the surface receptor for fibrin and vWF binding. Other activated platelets crosslink to fibrin and vWF at these sites, creating the platelet-fibrin plug.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen375">A. Secondary Hemostasis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Classically, the coagulation cascade is subcategorized into (1) the <strong><em>extrinsic pathway,</em></strong> activated by tissue factor (TF) from cells outside a disrupted blood vessel; (2) the <strong><em>intrinsic pathway,</em></strong> involving only plasma factors; and (3) the <strong><em>common pathway,</em></strong> fed by both the intrinsic and extrinsic to form thrombin, then fibrin (<strong><a href="#ff24-3">Figure 24.3</a></strong>). However, the extrinsic and common pathways also amplify the intrinsic pathway. Each of these three pathways has a central enzyme complex with four parallel elements: a plasma enzyme, a cofactor (mostly cell or platelet derived), the Ca<sup>++</sup> ion, and a phospholipid (PL) platform provided in vivo by the platelet membrane.</p>
<a id="page517"></a>
<p class="indent">The extrinsic pathway activates factor X to Xa via the extrinsic &#x201C;ten-ase,&#x201D; comprising enzyme factor VIIa (activated by TF), its cofactor TF, Ca<sup>++</sup>, and PL. The intrinsic pathway activates Xa with the intrinsic ten-ase, containing enzyme IXa, cofactor VIIIa, Ca<sup>++</sup>, and PL. In the common pathway, the Xa enzyme formed by these processes combines with cofactor Va, Ca<sup>++</sup>, and PL to form prothrombinase. Prothrombin is then converted to thrombin, which in turn converts fibrinogen to the end product fibrin.</p>
<p class="indent">When thrombin is formed, it also amplifies the intrinsic VIIIa to IXa ten-ase: thrombin activates VIIIa and XIa, which produces IXa. The extrinsic ten-ase also makes some IXa for the intrinsic ten-ase. Thrombin amplifies its own prothrombinase by activating some plasma Va. However, platelets provide most of the Va by taking up plasma factor V, converting it to Va, and then secreting Va during platelet activation. Finally, thrombin also activates factor XIII, which crosslinks and stabilizes the fibrin clot.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen376">B. Fibrinolysis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fibrin is broken down by plasmin after the need for hemostasis has resolved. Plasmin is activated from plasminogen in several ways: (1) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) from endothelial cells cleaves plasminogen and is itself activated by plasmin; (2) urokinase from the endothelium and kidney activates plasminogen; (3) factor IXa and the contact factors XIIa and kallikrein, associated with the intrinsic pathway, activate a minor fraction of plasminogen. Contact factors can activate XIa during in vitro testing (partial thromboplastin time) but not in vivo. Fibrinolysis is also regulated. The &#x03B1;<sub>1</sub>-antiplasmin and thrombin-activated fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) inhibit plasmin. TAFI and plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) interfere with tPA function, and PAI-1 promotes clearance of tPA and urokinase.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen377">C. Regulation of Hemostasis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Platelet activation is physiologically inhibited by nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin I<sub>2</sub> (PGI<sub>2</sub>) secreted by endothelial cells. NO stimulates a pathway leading to inhibition of the thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> receptor. PGI<sub>2</sub> binds to a platelet receptor, which signals for suppression of vWF adherence, PLC function, and thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> activation.</p>
<p class="indent">Secondary hemostasis is also regulated at several junctures (<strong><a href="#ff24-3">Figure 24.3</a></strong>). Tissue factor pathway inhibitor, secreted by endothelial cells and facilitated by its cofactor protein S, dampens functions of extrinsic TF-VIIa ten-ase and the common pathway Xa. Antithrombin, particularly when bound to heparin, inhibits thrombin and all the other enzyme factors.</p>
<p class="indent">Activated protein C cleaves extrinsic VIIIa and common-pathway Va. Protein C is activated by protein C-ase, comprising the enzyme thrombin, a cofactor thrombomodulin secreted by endothelial cells, Ca<sup>++</sup>, and PL.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Use of low-dose aspirin is ubiquitous among patients because it is an effective prophylaxis against myocardial infarction. It acts by irreversibly inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase and impairing platelet aggregation. It should be discontinued more than a week before intraocular or intracranial surgery to reduce the risk of devastating hemorrhage.</p>
