<h5 class="h5" id="sen123">A. Acetaminophen</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>1. Overview</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Acetaminophen (paracetamol, para-acetylaminophenol, <em>N</em>-acetyl-para-aminophenol) has been used clinically since 1955 and is the most widely used antipyretic in the United States. It is combined with other analgesics, such as opioids, in some formulations. Consequently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has limited the acetaminophen content in those combination formulations to 325&#x00A0;mg per tablet. Acetaminophen remains a leading cause of drug overdose and acute liver failure.<sup><a href="ch010-sec04.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup> <strong><em>Centrilobular hepatotoxicity</em></strong> occurs with acute overdose and may occur at smaller doses in chronic alcoholics. <strong><em>Liver transplantation</em></strong> may be offered to patients with acute liver failure.<sup><a href="ch010-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested that manufacturers of acetaminophen-containing products limit those products to a maximum of 325&#x00A0;mg of acetaminophen per dose to decrease the chance of hepatic toxicity.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">2. Mechanism of Action</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The exact mechanism of action of acetaminophen is not fully understood. The analgesic effect likely occurs from central sites of action, such as activation of descending inhibitory serotonergic pathways and modulation of cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways. The antipyretic effect results from actions within the hypothalamus.</p>
<a id="page187"></a>
<h6 class="h6">3. Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics</h6>
<p class="nonindent">See <strong><a href="#tt10-1">Table 10.1</a></strong>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">4. Metabolism and Excretion</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver by <strong><em>glucuronidation</em></strong> and <strong><em>sulfonation</em></strong>. The nontoxic conjugates that are formed are excreted in the urine and bile. When these pathways become saturated, acetaminophen metabolization occurs via cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathways that produce a toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). The NAPQI metabolite interacts with hepatic glutathione to produce a nontoxic compound that is eventually excreted as mercapturic acid and cysteine conjugates. If glutathione levels are depleted, or the system is overwhelmed, oxidative hepatocyte injury and <strong><em>hepatocellular centrilobular necrosis</em></strong> may ensue because of the NAPQI metabolite. Approximately 2% of ingested acetaminophen is excreted unchanged by the kidneys.</p>

<a id="page189"></a>
<h6 class="h6">5. Drug Interactions and Adverse Effects</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patient factors and clinical comorbidities may make patients more prone to liver injury following acetaminophen use. Factors that may increase the risk of acetaminophen toxicity include concomitant use of herbal medications or CYP-inducing drugs such as anticonvulsants and conditions in which glutathione stores are low including malnutrition or alcohol ingestion. <strong><em>N-acetylcysteine</em></strong> therapy can be provided to patients who have ingested excess acetaminophen to decrease hepatic injury. Administration of N-acetylcysteine requires clinicians to have a high index of suspicion for the nonspecific symptoms of acetaminophen overdose, and treatment should be initiated prior to the onset of liver injury, usually within 8 hours of acute acetaminophen ingestion. Doses of acetaminophen up to 4&#x00A0;g/d are generally safe. Hepatotoxicity has been reported, rarely, at doses less than 4&#x00A0;g/d; therefore, a maximum dose of 3&#x00A0;g/d has been recommended in adults with normal liver function if acetaminophen will be used for more than 7&#x00A0;days. In patients with risk factors, such as malnutrition, advanced age, or heavy alcohol use, a lower maximum dose of 2&#x00A0;g/d may be recommended.<sup><a href="ch010-sec04.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen124">B. Acetylsalicylic Acid</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>1. Overview</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Aspirin, or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is one type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), but it is the only acetylated NSAID. Aspirin was first introduced by <strong><em>Bayer</em></strong> in 1899. Although NSAIDs decrease inflammation and exhibit analgesic, antipyretic, and antiplatelet properties, aspirin is primarily used for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular conditions nowadays.</p>
<h6 class="h6">2. Mechanism of Action</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Aspirin <strong><em>irreversibly</em></strong> inhibits both cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), but it is weakly more selective for COX-1. Aspirin&#x2019;s effects vary depending on the dose used. At low doses (ie, 81&#x00A0;mg PO daily), aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 to inhibit platelet generation of thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>, which subsequently causes an <strong><em>antithrombotic</em></strong> effect (<strong><a href="#ff10-1">Figure 10.1</a></strong>). Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent: an acetyl group covalently binds to a serine residue at the active site of the COX enzyme; this interaction is <strong><em>irreversible</em></strong> and renders the COX enzyme inactive for the duration of the lifetime of the platelet (8-10&#x00A0;days). At intermediate doses (ie, 650-4000&#x00A0;mg/d), both COX-1 and COX-2 are irreversibly inhibited; therefore, prostaglandin production is blocked, resulting in analgesic and antipyretic effects. Higher doses may be used in rheumatologic disorders, but high doses are limited by toxicity and gastrointestinal (GI) irritation. Aspirin may protect cells against oxidative stress.<sup><a href="ch010-sec04.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup></p>
<h6 class="h6">3. Metabolism and Excretion</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Aspirin undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism and has an absorption half-life of 5 to 16 minutes. Aspirin is metabolized to salicylic acid by nonspecific esterases in the liver and less so in the stomach, and salicylic acid excretion is highly variable. Salicylic acid has less metabolic activity, and its serum half-life is dose dependent. Aspirin is highly bound to albumin.<sup><a href="ch010-sec04.xhtml#bib6">6</a></sup> Aspirin overdose or toxicity causes an anion gap metabolic acidosis, renal failure, dehydration, tinnitus, or seizures. These patients require <strong><em>alkaline diuresis</em></strong> to promote salicylate excretion and may require hemodialysis. Patients with aspirin overdose require intensive care.</p>

<h6 class="h6">4. Drug Interactions and Adverse Effects</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Aspirin is used as an antithrombotic drug because it irreversibly inactivates COX-1, which then blocks thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> synthesis for the lifetime of the platelet. Therefore, aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet aggregation and prolongs bleeding time. Once the affected platelets are replaced by normally functioning platelets, bleeding time normalizes. Aspirin, at low doses, is sometimes used in pregnancy for patients at risk for preeclampsia or other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Aspirin is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and can <strong><em>erode gastric mucosa</em></strong>. Aspirin causes <strong><em>acute tubular necrosis</em></strong> secondary to decreased renal blood flow, and patients can exhibit an intolerance to salicylates. An intolerance should be suspected in patients who have <strong><em>Samter triad</em></strong>: asthma or atopy, nasal polyps, and aspirin sensitivity. Aspirin can exacerbate these patients&#x2019; respiratory disease and <strong><em>precipitate bronchospasm</em></strong>. <strong><em>Reye syndrome</em></strong> is linked to the use of aspirin in children and young adults who recently had a viral illness; for this reason, it is not recommended to administer aspirin to children younger than 20&#x00A0;years.</p>

<ul class="bblue"><li><span>Ibuprofen</span></li>
<li><span>Ketorolac</span></li>
<li><span>Indomethacin</span></li>
<li><span>Diclofenac</span></li>

<li><span>Celecoxib</span></li></ul>
<a id="page191"></a>
<h6 class="h6">1. Overview</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nonselective NSAIDs (nsNSAIDs) are widely used across the world, but NSAIDs are one class of medications that contributes to preventable drug-related hospital admissions. Both COX-1 and COX-2 are inhibited by nsNSAIDs. While many believe nsNSAIDs are safe, their side effect profile includes gastroduodenal ulcers, renal dysfunction, inhibition of platelet aggregation, bronchospasm, and incomplete bone healing. NSAIDs were theorized to reduce bone healing as the inflammatory response is crucial for tissue repair; however, a causal relationship between bone healing following long bone fractures and use of NSAIDs has not been demonstrated. Further, differences in NSAID effects on healing of long bones and spinal bones may exist. COX-2 inhibitors were developed to mitigate the GI and antiplatelet side effects as COX-2 activity has not been found in platelets. Rofecoxib, a COX-2&#x2013;selective NSAID, was approved by the FDA in 1999 but voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 2004 because patients had an increased risk of cardiovascular events, specifically myocardial infarction and stroke. Valdecoxib was withdrawn from the market a year later. The adverse cardiovascular events are probably due to elevations in blood pressure that occur with all NSAIDs rather than any particular risk associated with COX-2 inhibitors.<sup><a href="ch010-sec04.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup> Prior to the withdrawal of these drugs, studies had shown that older adults prescribed opioids are more likely to die than patients receiving NSAIDs. Celecoxib remains the only COX-2&#x2013;specific inhibitor that is available in the United States currently. Because celecoxib has no effect on platelet function, it is especially useful in the perioperative period.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The rate of upper gastrointestinal complications is highest with ketorolac compared with other NSAIDS, and therefore, it should not be used for more than 5 consecutive days.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Ketorolac, an nsNSAID, has similar efficacy to standard doses of morphine and meperidine and is thus <strong><em>opioid sparing</em></strong>. As such, it decreases the common opioid side effects such as postoperative nausea and vomiting, constipation or ileus, and cardiorespiratory depression.</p>
<p class="indent">The risk of GI complications exists for all NSAIDs, including COX-2 inhibitors. Ketorolac has one of the <strong><em>highest</em></strong> relative risks for upper GI complications. Proton pump inhibitors offer protection against peptic ulcers when administered with nsNSAIDs, but COX-2&#x2013;selective NSAIDs may be more protective of the small intestine. GI prophylaxis is often recommended to patients who are prescribed NSAIDs.</p>
<h6 class="h6">2. Mechanism of Action</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The primary mechanism of action of nsNSAIDs is competitive inhibition of the COX enzymes, thereby preventing the creation of prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxanes from arachidonic acid. COX-1 is expressed ubiquitously, whereas COX-2 is more specifically expressed in the bone, brain, and kidney. Increased expression of COX-2 occurs in states of inflammation and stress. It was hypothesized that inhibiting the COX-2 enzyme would specifically decrease inflammation with minimal effect on the COX-1 functions and limit GI side effects. COX-2&#x2013;specific inhibitors, like celecoxib, exhibit similar analgesia to nsNSAIDs but have less risk of GI symptoms and inhibition of platelet aggregation and adhesion. These drugs exhibit a 300-fold selectivity for inhibiting COX-2 compared to COX-1. The FDA, however, still markets COX-2&#x2013;specific inhibitors in the same safety class as nsNSAIDs. COX-2&#x2013;selective NSAIDs do not precipitate bronchospasm like some nsNAIDs or aspirin. Some NSAIDs are slightly more selective for reversible inhibition of COX-2 than COX-1, including meloxicam and nabumetone. Relative inhibition<a id="page192"></a> of COX-2 over COX-1 decreases as the dose of nabumetone increases. The active metabolite of nabumetone equally inhibits both COX isoforms, albeit weakly. Meloxicam and diclofenac also inhibit COX-2 more than COX-1, especially at lower doses. Other anti-inflammatory effects of NSAIDs may exist independent of the COX pathway and include interactions with basic cell functions, neutrophil activity, interference of cell adherence, and inhibition of nitric oxide synthase.<sup><a href="ch010-sec04.xhtml#bib8">8</a>,<a href="ch010-sec04.xhtml#bib9">9</a></sup></p>
<h6 class="h6">3. Metabolism and Excretion</h6>
<p class="nonindent">NSAIDs undergo minimal first-pass hepatic metabolism and are highly protein bound to albumin. NSAIDs are metabolized in the liver by <strong><em>conjugation</em></strong> or <strong><em>hydroxylation</em></strong> and eliminated <strong><em>renally</em></strong>. Clearance of oral, intravenous, and intramuscular doses is similar.<sup><a href="ch010-sec04.xhtml#bib10">10</a></sup></p>
<h6 class="h6">4. Drug Interactions and Adverse Effects</h6>
<p class="nonindent">An acute overdose of NSAIDs presents with nonspecific symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and drowsiness, but may also can be asymptomatic. Patients may have allergies, or pseudoallergic reactions, to NSAIDs. Concomitant use of NSAIDs with other antithrombotic medications may put patients at higher bleeding risk. Indomethacin can be used as a tocolytic agent in women who present in preterm labor; however, indomethacin (an nsNSAID) is limited to less than 3&#x00A0;days in this patient population given the risk of premature closure of the patent ductus arteriosus. NSAIDs exhibit a risk of adverse cardiovascular events, acute kidney injury, and gastroduodenal ulcers. To mitigate these risks, NSAIDs should be administered at the lowest possible effective dose for the shortest amount of time possible. COX-2&#x2013;selective NSAIDs, while they may minimize GI side effects, are more likely to cause Stevens-Johnson syndrome than nsNSAIDs. Other adverse effects include anaphylactoid reactions and aseptic meningitis. Topical NSAIDs are absorbed and penetrate locally and may have limited systemic absorption and side effects. Ketorolac is opioid sparing, but the total cumulative dose (either parenteral or parenteral and oral) should be limited to 5&#x00A0;days. NSAIDs are contraindicated in patients with <strong><em>renal insufficiency</em></strong> because even short courses can produce transient reductions in kidney function.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen126">D. <strong><em>N</em></strong>-Methyl-<small>D</small>-Aspartate Receptor Antagonists</h5>
<ul class="bblue"><li><span>Ketamine</span></li>
<li><span>Methadone</span></li>
<li><span>Dextromethorphan</span></li>
<li><span>Memantine</span></li></ul>
<h6 class="h6">1. Overview</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><em>N</em>-methyl-<small>D</small>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation allows the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, to traverse membranes. NMDA receptor activation is associated with noxious stimuli, hyperalgesia, and neuropathic pain, and NMDA receptor overactivation may be responsible for decreased opioid responsiveness. Ketamine is a strong NMDA receptor antagonist, while methadone and dextromethorphan are weaker antagonists; therefore, side effects from NMDA antagonism are more profound with ketamine. The central nervous system (CNS) side effects of ketamine include hallucinations, dissociations, nightmares, and sensory changes. At subanesthetic doses, ketamine can provide analgesia for neuropathic, ischemic, and complex pain syndromes.<a id="page193"></a> At low, subanesthetic doses, ketamine does not alter hemodynamics and many patients tolerate it well with minimal side effects. On the contrary, induction and anesthetic doses (&#x003E;1&#x00A0;mg/kg) of ketamine may cause hypertension, tachycardia, increased systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances (SVR, PVR). Ketamine should be used cautiously in patients in whom tachycardia, hypertension, or increased SVR and PVR may cause morbidity, such as those with ischemic heart disease or heart failure. As a negative inotrope and direct myocardial depressant, ketamine can cause hemodynamic decompensation. Patients who use or abuse opioids chronically display hyperalgesia; thus, ketamine is especially useful in this patient population. Studies have shown that patients who receive low-dose intravenous ketamine infusions during major surgery have better analgesia and less sedation postoperatively.<sup><a href="ch010-sec04.xhtml#bib11">11</a></sup> Methadone has also been used successfully for patients with opioid tolerance and neuropathic pain.</p>
<h6 class="h6">2. Mechanism of Action</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The NMDA receptor is found throughout the spinal cord and brain and in many of the same locations as opioid receptors. The NMDA receptor binds glutamate and requires glycine as an endogenous co-agonist. NMDA receptors conduct calcium. Pre- or postsynaptic NMDA receptor activation can potentiate excitatory inputs to dorsal horn neurons and increase synaptic transmission. Together, this may clinically present as hyperalgesia, allodynia, neuropathic, and chronic pain.<sup><a href="ch010-sec04.xhtml#bib12">12</a></sup> Ketamine is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist. NMDA receptor antagonism may block the development of chronic pain states and mitigate the development of tolerance to analgesic effects of opioids.</p>
<h6 class="h6">3. Metabolism and Excretion</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Methadone has a long and variable half-life ranging from 6 to 60 hours. Methadone may prolong the QTc of a patient&#x2019;s ECG and interacts with drugs that are metabolized by CYP450 enzymes in the liver, specifically CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Ketamine undergoes hepatic biotransformation through CYP450 isozymes 3A4, 2B6, and 2C9. CYP3A4 metabolizes ketamine to its active metabolite, <strong><em>norketamine</em> (<a href="#tt10-1">Table 10.1</a>)</strong>. Ketamine can be marketed as a racemic mixture, but the <em>S-</em>ketamine enantiomer has increased affinity for the NMDA receptor when compared to the <em>R</em>-enantiomer. Ketamine is water- and lipid-soluble; thus, ketamine can be administered in multiple routes. Dextromethorphan, commonly found in cough medications, has been investigated for neuropathic pain. It is metabolized by CYP2D6 in the liver to an active metabolite, dextrorphan.</p>
<h6 class="h6">4. Drug Interactions and Adverse Effects</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Ketamine and methadone provide analgesia, especially useful for patients who are on chronic opioids or have neuropathic pain. CNS effects of ketamine are limiting and include hallucinations. These <strong><em>psychomimetic</em></strong> effects may be attenuated by administering a benzodiazepine prior to ketamine. Adverse reactions after ketamine administration, however, are dose related and more likely with anesthetic doses than analgesic doses. Ketamine is a direct myocardial depressant and can lead to hemodynamic decompensation in some patients. Ketamine is also a sialogogue. Weaker NMDA receptor antagonists, such as dextromethorphan and memantine, may possess analgesic benefit but have not been as well studied.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen127">E. <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub>-Adrenergic Receptor Agonists: Clonidine and Dexmedetomidine</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>1. Overview</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">The <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor is a G-protein&#x2013;coupled receptor located within the brain and spinal cord and peripherally. Agonists of <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub>-receptor are used for sedation and analgesia and decrease agitation and sympathetic tone. Studies support that dexmedetomidine causes a state like non&#x2013;rapid eye movement physiology without any change in cognitive function. Dexmedetomidine does not inhibit respiratory drive, which makes it a common medication in intensive care units to facilitate extubation. Dexmedetomidine provides effective opioid-sparing analgesia for many patients, including patients who are on high doses of opioids, and may reduce the incidence of opioid-related adverse events. Dexmedetomidine decreases emergence delirium in children.</p>
<h6 class="h6">2. Mechanism of Action</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><em>&#x03B1;</em>-Receptor agonists inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity and function <strong><em>supraspinally</em></strong>, where they regulate dopamine, norepinephrine, and other physiologic pathways. Analgesic actions may be related to the effects of <em>&#x03B1;</em>-receptors within the spinal cord, although many of these medications cross the blood-brain barrier. The <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2A</sub>-receptor subtype is in the spinal cord and brain, including the locus coeruleus and cerebral cortex, where it mediates analgesia and sedation. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2A</sub> agonist. Clonidine is a nonselective <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub> agonist. Other receptor subtypes, <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2B</sub> and <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2C</sub>, are located within the brain. Medications that have different binding affinities for the <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub>-receptor subtypes may have differing indications. For example, <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2A</sub>-selective agonists, such as guanfacine, are used as antihypertensives. <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub>-Receptor antagonists are also used for some psychiatric conditions.</p>
<h6 class="h6">3. Metabolism and Excretion</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Clonidine is partially metabolized by the liver into inactive metabolites and excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Dexmedetomidine is metabolized by glucuronidation and oxidation within the liver and excreted in the urine.</p>
<h6 class="h6">4. Drug Interactions and Adverse Effects</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub>-Receptor agonists cause hypotension and bradycardia. Clonidine causes these effects through a reduction in CNS-mediated sympathetic activity. Dexmedetomidine facilitates postoperative recovery and spares opioid usage postoperatively. Research has investigated the addition of <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub> agonists to local anesthetics for administration of peripheral nerve blockade, but there is no widely accepted consensus regarding their use in this specific realm.</p>
