<h4 class="h4" id="sec17">X. Pulmonary Function Testing</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen34">A. Forced Vital Capacity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The forced vital capacity (FVC) test is performed by having the patient inhale maximally and then forcefully exhaling as rapidly and thoroughly as possible into a spirometer. The overall volume should be equal to the vital capacity. The value of the FVC is that the measurement is done at maximal expiratory effort over a certain amount of time. As a result, maximal flows can be calculated at particular lung volumes. Because the flow cannot be increased above a maximum rate for a given lung volume at maximal effort, the test results are generally very reproducible with adequate patient cooperation. Normal values of this test are dependent on the patient&#x2019;s height, age, sex, and race.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen35">B. Forced Expiratory Volume</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) test is performed by measuring the volume of air expired at maximal effort in the first 1 second of exhalation at maximal effort after a maximal inhalation. Because it is a measurement of volume over a specific period, it is a measure of flow. The FEV<sub>1</sub> can be decreased by both obstructive conditions and restrictive conditions, and by poor patient cooperation or poor effort.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen36">C. FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC Ratio</h5>
<p class="nonindent">One of the more useful calculations is the ratio of the FEV<sub>1</sub> to the FVC. It helps to elucidate whether a patient has a restrictive or obstructive etiology of decreased FEV<sub>1</sub> and is expressed as a percentage. A normal patient is able to expel 75% to 85% of his or her FVC in the first second of maximal expiratory effort. In patients with a predominantly obstructive process, the FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio is reduced. In restrictive lung processes, the FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC are generally reduced proportionally to each other, so the ratio is normal to even slightly elevated due to increased elastic recoil of the lung.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen37">D. Forced Expiratory Flow</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Another common measurement is the forced expiratory flow (FEF). There are a few different types of FEF measurements. They are differentiated by the point during exhalation of the FVC at which they are measured. One of the more common values is the FEF<sub>25%-50%</sub>. It is an average FEF of the middle 50% of the FVC. It is thought to be more sensitive for detection of early, mild obstructive pulmonary processes and it is not effort dependent. Other measures are the FEF<sub>50%</sub> and FEF<sub>75%</sub>, which are the flows present after 50% of <a id="page31"></a>the FVC has been exhaled and 75% has been exhaled, respectively. All these values are decreased in the setting of obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen38">E. Maximal Voluntary Ventilation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) is a pulmonary function test that is used to evaluate a patient&#x2019;s exercise capacity as well as his or her ability to tolerate major surgery. The patient is asked to breathe as hard and as fast as he or she can for 10 to 15 seconds. The total volume over this time is measured and then extrapolated to 1 minute. Numerous conditions can cause a reduction in MVV. These include obstructive and restrictive lung conditions, heart disease, neuromuscular impairment, and lack of patient cooperation or understanding (<strong><a href="#tt2-1">Table 2.1</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib2">2</a>,<a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib13">13</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen39">F. Flow-Volume Loops</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Flow-volume loops are graphic representations of the respiratory cycle. The gas flow rate is represented on the x-axis and lung volume on the y-axis (<strong><a href="#ff2-12">Figure 2.12</a></strong>). Notice that expiratory flow in <strong><a href="#ff2-12">Figure 2.12</a></strong> is above zero on the x-axis and inspiratory flow is below. These graphic representations were previously very commonly used to ascertain whether obstruction of large airways was intrathoracic or extrathoracic. With the advent of modern imaging modalities, this method has become less useful, although it is important to note the change in morphology of the curve with different types of obstruction (<strong><a href="#ff2-13">Figure 2.13</a></strong>). As demonstrated in <strong><a href="#ff2-13">Figure 2.13</a></strong>, a variable nonfixed extrathoracic obstruction will produce a flattened curve in the inspiratory part of the cycle. A variable nonfixed intrathoracic obstruction will result in a flattened expiratory portion of the loop. A fixed obstruction produces flattened curves in both parts of the cycle regardless of its position.<sup><a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib2">2</a>,<a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib13">13</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen40">G. Carbon Monoxide Diffusing Capacity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The transfer of oxygen from the alveolus to erythrocyte is done through diffusion. Three main variables affect the diffusion of oxygen into the bloodstream. They are as follows:</p>
<ol class="u_num2"><li><span>Area of the interface between alveolus and capillary&#x2014;the greater the area, the greater the capacity for diffusion.</span></li>
<li><span>Thickness of the membrane between the two&#x2014;the thicker the membrane, the lower the amount of diffusion.</span></li>
<li><span>The difference in oxygen tension between alveolar gas and venous blood&#x2014;the greater the difference, the greater the amount of oxygen diffused.</span></li>

<p class="indent">It is very difficult to measure the diffusing capacity of oxygen because the partial pressure of oxygen varies so greatly over time within the pulmonary vascular system. An ideal surrogate is carbon monoxide whose normal partial pressure within the circulation approaches zero. It has an affinity for hemoglobin that is 20 times stronger than that of oxygen. Therefore, its level throughout the pulmonary circulation remains relatively constant for the purposes of measurement.</p>
<p class="indent">The most widely used test to determine the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is the single breath method. The patient is asked to exhale completely, followed by inhalation to total lung capacity of a gas mixture containing a low concentration of carbon monoxide and an inert gas such as helium. After reaching total lung capacity, the patient is asked to hold his or her breath for 10 seconds, then exhale completely again to residual volume. The concentration of carbon monoxide is then measured in the exhaled sample.</p>
<p class="indent">Decreases in the DLCO can be caused by a variety of reasons. These can be divided mainly into conditions that affect the area available for diffusion or increase the thickness of the alveolar-capillary membrane (<strong><a href="#tt2-2">Table 2.2</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib14">14</a></sup></p>
