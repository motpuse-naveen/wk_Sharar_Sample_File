<h4 class="h4" id="sec85">II. Delivery of Gases: High-, Intermediate-, and Low-Pressure Systems</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Most anesthesia workstations receive a dual supply of medical-grade gases. Oxygen is delivered at high pressure from the central hospital supply source (liquid oxygen tanks) into the operating room through readily<a id="page289"></a> visible green hoses or, alternatively, can be delivered from a cylinder (size E) of oxygen attached to the anesthesia machine. Air is color coded in yellow. Note that these color designations apply to medical centers located in the United States and vary internationally. A third supply line of nitrous oxide at high pressure, coded in blue, or a backup supply of nitrous oxide stored in an E-cylinder attached to the anesthesia machine may also be present.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> The delivery of these gases through the anesthesia machine and ultimately to the patient is marked by a progressive, regulated decrement in pressure. Wall source gases are delivered to the anesthesia machine at a pressure of 50 pounds per square inch (psi). E-cylinders contain considerably higher pressures but are regulated to 45 psi prior to their interface with the anesthesia machine.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup> The user further regulates and fine-tunes the low-pressure flow of gases to the patient using flow control knobs specific to each gas. <strong><a href="#tt14-1">Table 14.1</a></strong> lists pressure readings encountered in the anesthesia workstation.</p>

<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Most operating rooms have a reliable wall source of oxygen. However, if this should fail, a low-pressure alarm will be triggered. The green oxygen hose attached to the back of the anesthesia machine should be disconnected and the auxiliary oxygen E-cylinder turned on.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Pressure gauges reflective of both wall and cylinder sources of medical gases are displayed on the anesthesia machine. The gauges for the central hospital gas sources measure the <strong><em>intermediate</em></strong> in-line working pressure and typically read approximately 50 to 55 psi. The most common reason why this pressure reading would decrease is that the hose from the wall source has been disconnected from the anesthesia machine, but it could also result from a complete or partial failure of the central hospital gas source. This pressure gauge reading remains constant through the routine and continuous use of wall source gases even when used at high flow rates. In contrast, the gauges for medical gas cylinders reflect the <strong><em>high</em></strong> internal pressure of the cylinders themselves. A full E-cylinder of oxygen or air will contain roughly 625&#x00A0;L of gas at a pressure of 2200 psi. The pressure will drop proportionately as these gases are used.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a>-<a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> If a tank is used to oxygenate the patient at 10&#x00A0;L/min, then it will only last approximately 60 minutes.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup> A full tank of nitrous oxide contains 1590&#x00A0;L of gas at a pressure of 745 psi. Nitrous oxide, in contrast to oxygen and air, exists as a combination of liquid and gas inside its compressed cylinder due to its physicochemical properties and critical temperature. As a result, continuous use of a nitrous oxide cylinder will <strong><em>not</em></strong> result in a pressure drop at the gauge until nearly 75% (1200&#x00A0;L) of the nitrous oxide in the cylinder has<a id="page290"></a> been used. During the routine use of the anesthesia machine, the E-cylinder sources are kept in the off position as these are intended for use only during central pipeline failure. If such an event occurs, two actions are to be undertaken. First, the central pipeline gas source is disconnected from the anesthesia machine. Second, the E-cylinder is turned to the on position so that continued oxygenation and ventilation of the patient may proceed.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a>-<a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup></p>
<div class="figure" id="ff14-2"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff14-2.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="caption"><span class="fignum">Figure&#160;14.2</span> A flowmeter assembly and Thorpe tube. The black circle represents the floating bobbin, which indicates the current flow rate being used. Low flows at the narrow end of the tapered glass tube (eg, 100&#x00A0;mL/min) are characterized as laminar and viscosity dependent. In contrast, high flows at the large diameter end of the tube (eg, 10&#x00A0;L/min) are turbulent and density dependent.</figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen201">A. Flowmeters</h5>
<p class="nonindent">From the flowmeter assembly onward, the anesthesia machine is considered a <strong><em>low</em></strong>-pressure system. The anesthesiologist may individually manipulate the flow of air, oxygen, and nitrous oxide to achieve flow rates of 0.2&#x00A0;L/min to more than 10&#x00A0;L/min for each gas. The fine control over the flow of these gases is achieved as they pass through specialized, variable orifice glass tubes known as Thorpe tubes. The height of a floating bobbin within the tapered lumen (increasing internal diameter) of these tubes indicates the current flow rate being used (<strong><a href="#ff14-2">Figure 14.2</a></strong>). At very low flow rates (0.1-0.3&#x00A0;L/min), the passage of gas molecules through the smaller diameter section of these tubes is laminar. Concentric telescoping tubes of gas molecules moving parallel to one another in this fashion are influenced by gas <strong><em>viscosity</em></strong> or, in other words, the frictional properties between the inner surface of an outer layer of gas flow and the outer surface of the inner layer adjacent to it. In contrast, at high flow rates in the large diameter section of the Thorpe tube (5-10&#x00A0;L/min), gas flow is turbulent, which<a id="page291"></a> is characterized by the random trajectory of gas molecules, although en masse, there is bulk movement of air in the antegrade direction. In this scenario, flow is significantly affected by gas <strong><em>density</em></strong>. Larger gas molecules will result in greater intermolecular collisions and hence greater impedance to gas flow.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen202">B. Flush Actuator and One-Way Check Valve</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Thus far, the discussion of gas delivery from its source to the patient has followed a single path that begins with very high pressures. However, it is ultimately received by the patient&#x2019;s lungs under low pressure conditions within agreeable physiologic limits. Anesthesia machines are equipped with an alternate pathway for oxygen that may expose the patient to the intermediate pressure system. The <strong><em>flush actuator</em></strong> permits the application of oxygen flow from the in-line working pressure of 55 psi through the common gas outlet to the patient. Flow rates of oxygen through this alternate pathway that bypass the flowmeters can range from 35 to 75&#x00A0;L/min. As a matter of perspective, using the flush valve to inflate a patient&#x2019;s lungs exposes the patient to roughly 200 times the typical inflation pressures used during routine mechanical ventilation. One may wonder why this pathway exists at all. Should the patient somehow become disconnected from the anesthesia breathing apparatus during controlled ventilation, the ventilator bellows (or the breathing bag) will immediately deflate as the volume of gas within will be drained into the operating room environment. The flush actuator could be used to rapidly increase the volume of gas in the system, so that normal tidal volumes may resume. This should be undertaken with care and advisably only during the <strong><em>expiratory</em></strong> phase of respiration when any excess gas or pressure resulting from the use of the flush valve can be scavenged away from the system (see &#x201C;Scavenging Systems&#x201D; later in this chapter). Additionally, the flush valve may be used for more complex ventilation strategies such as high-frequency jet ventilation.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The oxygen flush actuator (&#x201C;flush valve&#x201D;) delivers oxygen at high pressure and flow directly to the common gas outlet. Its primary purpose is to enable rapid filling of a deflated rebreathing bag or ventilator bellows.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">A further consideration involves the potential presence of a one-way check valve just <strong><em>upstream</em></strong> of where the flush actuator joins the fresh gas outlet to the patient. This valve is present on many models of Datex-Ohmeda (GE Healthcare Company) brand workstations and allows for the unidirectional flow of gas only in the antegrade route. As a consequence, using the flush valve exposes the patient to <strong><em>all</em></strong> of the oxygen flow from the intermediate pressure system. In the absence of this one-way check valve, as is the case in Dr&#x00E4;ger workstations (Dr&#x00E4;ger Medical Inc), some of the oxygen flow from flushing the system may course in a retrograde fashion (<strong><a href="#ff14-3">Figure 14.3</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen203">C. Safeguards in the Delivery of Medical Gases</h5>
<p class="nonindent">It is imperative that the anesthesiologist verifies the presence of adequate gas supply pressures for both the wall source and the auxiliary E-cylinder(s) during the preuse check of the workstation (see &#x201C;Anesthesia Workstation Preuse Checkout&#x201D; later in this chapter). Acceptable gas pressure readings, however, still do not guarantee that the <strong><em>correct</em></strong> gas is in fact being delivered to the patient. Misconnecting a nitrous oxide wall hose or nitrous cylinder to the noncorresponding interface for oxygen could result in the delivery of a hypoxic gas mixture. Thankfully, modern anesthesia systems help prevent such catastrophic occurrences. Wall source hoses are connected to the back of the anesthesia machine through noninterchangeable fittings, each with a diameter specific to its respective gas (the <strong><em>diameter index safety system</em></strong>). Additionally, E-cylinders for oxygen, air, and nitrous oxide each have a specific arrangement of two holes that mate with their corresponding pins on the yoke of the anesthesia machine (the Pin Index Safety System) (<strong><a href="#ff14-4">Figure 14.4</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup></p>

The presence of a one-way check valve (<em>red dot</em>) forces all of the high-flow oxygen to course antegrade into the fresh gas outlet (<em>solid green arrow</em>). In the absence of such a check valve, some of the oxygen will flow retrograde into the anesthesia machine (<em>dotted yellow arrow</em>).</figcaption></figure></div>

<p class="indent">Additional measures exist to ensure appropriate oxygenation of the patient. Consider the scenario in which a fresh gas mixture of 50% oxygen and 50% nitrous oxide is being used and an isolated drop in oxygen pipeline pressure occurs. The sequence in which these two gases enter the fresh gas main line impacts the resulting gas mixture delivered to the patient. Oxygen is always the last gas to sequentially enter the fresh gas mixture to minimize (but not eliminate) the alteration in inspired oxygen (<strong><a href="#ff14-5">Figure 14.5</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">Although inspection of the oxygen pipeline pressure gauge, a low O<sub>2</sub> pressure alarm, and low fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) concentration alarm would alert the user to the hazardous event described above, a mechanism known as the oxygen <strong><em>fail-safe system</em></strong> exists to minimize the decrement in FiO<sub>2</sub>. The fail-safe system proportionally decreases the flow of all other gases in use or halts their administration completely when a decline in oxygen pressure occurs. This prevents a disproportionate increase in the relative contribution of fresh gases that do not contribute to the oxygenation of the patient.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a>-<a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Even under conditions in which the integrity of the oxygen pipeline source is maintained, it would still be possible to deliver a hypoxic fresh gas mixture to a patient. Imagine that oxygen flow is set to 1&#x00A0;L/min and nitrous oxide is delivered concurrently at 4&#x00A0;L/min. In this situation, the consequent FiO<sub>2</sub> would be 20%, less than that of room air. <strong><em>Proportioning systems</em></strong> within the flowmeter assembly prevent exactly this type of problem from occurring. One possible design is the use of chain-linked sprockets that unite the control knobs for nitrous oxide and oxygen to each other. The effect imposes limits such that the ratio of nitrous oxide flow to oxygen flow never exceeds 3:1 (an FiO<sub>2</sub> of 25%). Other types of proportioning mechanisms actively reduce nitrous oxide flows when oxygen flows are decreased by the user.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">A properly functioning and calibrated oxygen analyzer is a mandatory part of the anesthesia workstation. There are several safeguards in modern machines to prevent delivery of a hypoxic gas mixture to the patient, but the oxygen analyzer is last in line and is the only device that actually measures the concentration.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Lastly, an <strong><em>oxygen analyzer</em></strong> oversees the delivered concentration of oxygen just beyond the fresh gas outlet. Although not a constituent of the anesthesia machine per se, it is a final check on what concentration of oxygen is in fact<a id="page294"></a> ultimately being administered to the patient. Although the anesthesiologist cannot ascertain the functionality of the oxygen fail-safe system, he or she has an opportunity and a responsibility to certify the functionality of <strong><em>all</em></strong> of the safeguards just described (see &#x201C;Anesthesia Workstation Preuse Checkout&#x201D; later in this chapter).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen204">D. Anesthetic Vaporizers</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Commonly used volatile anesthetics are halogenated ether compounds that readily vaporize when exposed to the atmosphere. If kept in a closed container, the space above the liquid will contain molecules of these agents in the vapor state, equilibrating with the liquid surface. The pressure exerted against the walls of the container in this space by the gas-phase molecules is known as <strong><em>vapor pressure</em></strong>. At standard temperature and pressure, the measured vapor pressure for volatile anesthetics reflects the unique physicochemical characteristics of these drugs. Vapor pressure, however, is not a static value and will increase if the ambient temperature rises. The temperature at which the kinetic energy of these molecules is sufficient to counterbalance the pressure of the atmosphere (760&#x00A0;mm Hg at sea level) is known as the agent&#x2019;s <strong><em>boiling point.</em></strong> At this temperature and beyond, <strong><em>all</em></strong> of the liquid agent will readily vaporize into gas.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup></p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Vaporizer Misfilling</strong></p>
<p class="indent"><strong><a href="#ff14-6">Figure 14.6</a></strong> illustrates how the concept of saturated vapor pressure is exploited to allow the safe use of volatile anesthetics in clinical anesthesia. <strong><em>Variable bypass vaporizers</em></strong> are typically installed on most anesthesia machines. They contain an internal reservoir of liquid anesthetic agent that saturates a large wick. Molecules of anesthetic in the gaseous state emanate from this wick to create a saturated vapor pressure within the vaporizing chamber. These vaporizers are referred to as <strong><em>variable bypass</em></strong> because when they are not in use, the fresh gas flow of oxygen/air/nitrous oxide &#x201C;bypasses&#x201D; these vaporizers and continues onward to the patient. When the control dial of the anesthetic vaporizer is rotated in the counterclockwise direction, it diverts a portion of the carrier gas to the internal vaporizing chamber, where it will incorporate a certain amount of anesthetic gas and then return to join the fresh gas flow where the mixture of anesthetic and oxygen will be delivered to the common gas outlet. The more the dial is turned, the greater the amount of anesthetic vapor incorporated and administered to the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">The transformation of a substance from the liquid state into the gas phase is an endothermic process. It requires energy to make this transition. Yet, most variable bypass vaporizers are not actively heated. Therefore, the energy required to continually vaporize liquid anesthetic into gas comes from the environment: the existing thermal energy of the operating room and the walls of the vaporizer itself. If the operating room is unusually cold or high fresh gas flow is being used, which requires vaporization of a large volume of anesthetic, the temperature in the vaporizing chamber may drop. Consequently, there will be a predictable and proportional decrease in the vapor pressure of the agent, and less anesthetic will be available in the gas state to be delivered to the patient. To allow for changing temperatures in the vaporizing chamber, a bimetallic switch is placed at the interface where fresh gas flow enters the vaporizing chamber. When two metals of differing thermal conductivities are joined together, one will expand or shrink at a rate much different from the other when the local temperature increases or decreases, respectively. The result will create shearing of one metal against another. When the internal<a id="page295"></a> temperature or vapor pressure falls, the bimetallic strip bends and allows more fresh gas flow to enter the vaporizing chamber to compensate (<strong><a href="#ff14-6">Figure 14.6</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup></p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen205">E. Desflurane and the Tec 6 Vaporizer</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Each variable bypass vaporizer described above is constructed to be agent specific and calibrated to accommodate an individual drug&#x2019;s unique vapor pressure and potency. Currently, these vaporizers are used to deliver isoflurane and sevoflurane.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Anesthetic vaporizers must be filled with the correct agent. Failure to do so could have disastrous consequences. This is particularly true for desflurane, which requires a specially designed heated vaporizer.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Desflurane, however, is a newer volatile anesthetic, which, unlike its predecessors, has a boiling point close to that of room temperature. This prohibits its use in a conventional variable bypass vaporizer. Whereas a conventional variable bypass vaporizer is characterized by two parallel circuits (a bypass pathway and a vaporizing pathway), the Tec 6 vaporizer (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) is more appropriately described as a <strong><em>single circuit gas-vapor blender</em></strong> (<strong><a href="ch014-sec03.xhtml#ff14-7">Figure 14.7</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib4">4</a>,<a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib6">6</a></sup> The Tec 6 vaporizer is uniquely designed to overcome the challenges posed by desflurane&#x2019;s low boiling point. In this system, a reservoir of liquid desflurane is actively heated to twice its boiling point, generating pure desflurane gas. This gas is then &#x201C;fuel injected&#x201D; directly into the fresh gas flow line based on how far the control dial setting is opened. Truthfully, with progress in medical technology, modern anesthesia machines have now incorporated the advanced pressure, temperature, and flow sensors developed in the Tec 6 into current models of variable bypass vaporizers. With the addition of advanced microprocessors, the result is a wide variety of proprietary vaporizer technology.</p>
