<h4 class="h4" id="sec195">II. Uteroplacental and Fetal Circulation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The uterus receives 15% of the cardiac output at term; normal uterine blood flow is 700 to 900&#x00A0;mL/min. Uterine blood flow is derived from the uterine arteries and additionally via collaterals from the ovarian and cervical arteries. Uterine (and therefore placental and fetal) blood flow is directly proportional to uterine perfusion pressure (defined as the difference between uterine arterial pressure vs uterine venous pressure), and inversely proportional to uterine artery vascular tone. The uterine vasculature is maximally vasodilated during pregnancy. A lack of uterine autoregulation makes blood flow proportional to perfusion pressure. Uterine vasculature maintains responsiveness to vasoconstrictors. Increases in uterine smooth muscle tone constrict uterine vessels, decreasing flow.</p>
<p class="indent">The fetus exchanges gases and nutrients with the mother via the placenta. Fetal placental villi containing fetal capillaries are bathed in maternal blood supplied by the spiral arteries, which are branches of the uterine arteries. A normal umbilical cord has three vessels: one vein containing oxygenated blood from the placenta and two arteries carrying deoxygenated blood and waste back to the placenta. A number of mechanisms of transport from mother to fetus and back exist, including simple diffusion (most common, due to fetal or maternal concentration gradient), transcellular transfer, endocytosis, and exocytosis. Oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs via simple diffusion; higher maternal Pa<span class="usmall">O</span><sub>2</sub> favors diffusion to the fetus, and fetal CO<sub>2</sub> is higher than maternal CO<sub>2</sub>, favoring diffusion back to the mother.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong><em>Fetal hemoglobin</em></strong> has greater O<sub>2</sub> carrying capacity. The Bohr effect is more profound in the fetus because fetal hemoglobin encounters more hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) in the fetus, which is relatively more acidotic than in the mother, and is more likely to release the O<sub>2</sub> it is carrying to fetal tissues. <strong><em>Fetal circulation</em></strong> differs from adult circulation in that it bypasses the lungs (<strong><a href="#ff31-2">Figure 31.2</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">The majority of maternally administered drugs will reach the fetus via the placenta. The fetal/maternal ratio describes the concentration of drug in the fetal umbilical vein versus maternal serum concentration. Nonionized, nonprotein-bound, lipid-soluble drugs with molecular weights below 600&#x00A0;Da easily cross the placenta. Large, ionized, hydrophilic drugs are less likely to transfer. Most anesthetic drugs cross the placenta, with the exception of paralyzing agents and glycopyrrolate. Heparin and insulin also do not cross the placenta. Transient fetal or neonatal depression can be seen after administration of induction agents, anesthetic gases, opioids, and benzodiazepines. The long-term effects of general anesthetic agents on neonatal outcome are unknown. Theoretically, nitrous oxide can interfere with DNA synthesis via oxidation of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. However, in animal studies only prolonged (&#x003E;24 hours) exposure to high-concentration nitrous oxide produces fetal loss.</p>

Oxygenated blood leaves the placenta in the umbilical vein (<em>vessel without stippling</em>). Umbilical blood joins blood from the viscera (represented here by the kidney, gut, and skin) in the inferior vena cava. Approximately half of the inferior vena cava flow passes through the foramen ovale to the left atrium, where it mixes with a small amount of pulmonary venous blood. This relatively well-oxygenated blood (<em>light stippling</em>) supplies the heart and brain by way of the ascending aorta. The other half of the inferior vena cava stream mixes with superior vena cava blood and enters the right ventricle (blood in the right atrium and ventricle has little oxygen, which is denoted by <em>heavy stippling</em>). Because the pulmonary arterioles are constricted, most of the blood in the main pulmonary artery flows through the ductus arteriosus (DA) so the descending aorta&#x2019;s blood has less oxygen (<em>heavy stippling</em>) than does blood in the ascending aorta (<em>light stippling</em>). B, Schematic representation of the circulation in the normal newborn. After expansion of the lungs and ligation of the umbilical cord, pulmonary blood flow and left atrial and systemic arterial pressures increase. When left atrial pressure exceeds right atrial pressure, the foramen ovale closes so all inferior and superior vena cava blood leaves the right atrium, enters the right ventricle, and is pumped through the pulmonary artery toward the lung. With the increase in systemic arterial pressure and decrease in pulmonary artery pressure, flow through the ductus arteriosus becomes left to right, and the ductus constricts and closes. The course of circulation is the same as in the adult.</strong> (Redrawn from Phibbs R. Delivery room management of the newborn.
