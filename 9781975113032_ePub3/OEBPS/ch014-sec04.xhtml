<h4 class="h4" id="sec87">IV. Scavenging Systems</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The primary determinant of the amount of waste gas scavenged is the fresh gas flow out of the common gas outlet. At very low flow rates, a relatively unchanging volume of gas will constantly oscillate between the patient&#x2019;s lungs and the breathing bag or ventilator, and very little gas will escape through the waste gas scavenging system. At high fresh gas flow rates, excess gas will vent through the scavenging system to prevent a buildup of volume and pressure. Both the mechanical ventilator and the breathing bag are connected to the scavenging terminal through 19-mm hose connectors. During manual or spontaneous ventilation, waste gas is vented through the APL. When the ventilator is in use, waste gas is vented during expiration. During that interval in the respiratory cycle, after a certain pressure threshold has been reached, typically 2&#x00A0;cm&#x00A0;H<sub>2</sub>O, the spill valve will open and vent the excess gas into the scavenging hose. From the scavenging terminal, a third hose directs the waste gas out of the operating room and ultimately out of the hospital (<strong><a href="#ff14-10">Figure 14.10</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">Once waste gas exits the anesthesia workstation, a variety of systems exist to dispose of them. A defining characteristic of scavenging systems relates to the dynamics of gas flow, which may be either <strong><em>active</em></strong> or <strong><em>passive</em></strong>. In active systems, negative pressure is applied through the hospital vacuum to facilitate the removal of waste gas. Passive systems rely simply on the small amount of positive pressure generated during exhalation to promote waste gas disposal. Scavenging systems may additionally be defined according to their anatomic design, either open or closed. Closed systems are self-explanatory: a system of hoses evacuates exhaled gas in a contained manner that prohibits the waste gas from entering the operating room. Open systems contain vents in the scavenging reservoir that <strong><em>do</em></strong> allow waste gas to <strong><em>potentially</em></strong> enter the operating room. At first glance, one may question the merit of an open system, a design that decidedly allows waste gas to contaminate the operating room environment. The following two examples serve to justify how open systems may be intrinsically safer than closed systems.</p>

<p class="indent">Think about what might happen if the hose that sends waste gases out of the room becomes occluded. In a closed system, waste gas would accumulate, generating positive pressure that could theoretically be conveyed to the patient. The presence of vents in the scavenging reservoir in an open system, however, would allow this excess pressure to dissipate into the operating room. Consider the opposite problem as well. Perhaps an excessive amount of negative pressure is applied to evacuate waste gas. In such a scenario, too <strong><em>much</em></strong> gas is being relieved from the circle system in closed designs. The very same vents described earlier in open systems would entrain room air to accommodate this excessive negative pressure. Closed systems are acceptable for use, but they must retain mechanisms that mitigate the problems illustrated by the above examples. Closed systems harbor positive-pressure and negative-pressure relief valves. The former bleeds open into the operating room when excessive pressure accumulates within the scavenging system. Negative-pressure relief valves, however, respond to excessive negative pressure and entrain room air to compensate.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a>-<a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup></p>

<p class="dify">Like competent pilots before they fly, it is highly recommended that the anesthesiologist performs a thorough check of the anesthesia workstation before use and, for quality control purposes, documents that it was done.</p>
