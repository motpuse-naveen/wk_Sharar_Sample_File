<h4 class="h4" id="sec224">III. Common Procedures and Pathologies</h4>
<p class="nonindent">This next section discusses various procedures that are commonly performed in a thoracic surgery practice and reviews the relevant pathologies and anesthetic considerations for each.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen624">A. Flexible Fiberoptic Bronchoscopy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy is a diagnostic and therapeutic modality for pathologies of the airways. It is also common to perform bronchoscopy prior to lung resections to reconfirm the diagnosis or determine invasion of the airway. Options include awake with topical anesthesia versus general anesthesia and oral versus nasal approaches. Airway management during general anesthesia can be performed with an endotracheal tube (ETT) or a laryngeal mask airway. <strong><em>Intravenous</em></strong> anesthesia is preferred if this procedure is going to be prolonged, as volatile agents <strong><em>may</em></strong> contaminate the operating room.<sup><a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen625">B. Rigid Bronchoscopy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Rigid bronchoscopy is the procedure of choice for dilation of <strong><em>tracheal stenosis</em></strong> with or without the use of a laser, foreign body removal, and massive hemoptysis. There are four basic methods of ventilation for rigid bronchoscopy: spontaneous ventilation; apneic oxygenation with or without the insufflation of oxygen; positive pressure ventilation (PPV) via the side arm of a ventilating bronchoscope; and jet ventilation with a handheld injector or high-frequency jet ventilator. Rigid bronchoscopy in children is most commonly managed with spontaneous ventilation and a volatile anesthetic. In adults, total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and the use of muscle relaxants is more common, with a combination of PPV via the bronchoscope side arm or jet ventilation. Pulse oximetry is vital during rigid bronchoscopy because there is a high risk of desaturation. However, monitoring of end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> and volatile anesthetics is less useful, because the airway remains essentially open to the atmosphere. Unlike during fiberoptic bronchoscopy via an ETT, with rigid bronchoscopy, the airway is never completely secure and there is always the potential for aspiration, especially in patients at increased risk. Complications of rigid bronchoscopy include airway perforation, mucosal damage, hemorrhage, postmanipulation airway edema, and potential airway loss at the end of the procedure.<sup><a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup></p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen626">C. Mediastinoscopy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Mediastinoscopy is a diagnostic procedure for the evaluation of lymph nodes in the staging of lung cancer and for <strong><em>anterior mediastinal masses</em></strong>. The most common mediastinal procedure is a cervical mediastinoscopy, in which the mediastinoscope is inserted through a small incision in the suprasternal notch and advanced toward the carina (<strong><a href="#ff35-4">Figure 35.4</a></strong>). The majority of these cases require general anesthesia with placement of an SLT. A pulse oximeter or arterial line can be used to monitor perfusion to the right arm, because compression of the innominate artery by the mediastinoscope may occur. The most severe complication of mediastinoscopy is <strong><em>major hemorrhage</em></strong>, which may require emergent sternotomy or thoracotomy. A large-bore intravenous <a id="page758"></a>line should be placed in a lower extremity in the event of an SVC tear. Other potential complications include airway obstruction, pneumothorax, paresis of the recurrent laryngeal, phrenic nerve injury, esophageal injury, chylothorax, and air embolism.<sup><a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen627">D. Pulmonary Resection</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Several techniques and approaches can be used for the resection of pulmonary tissue or tumor. Minimally invasive lung resection can be accomplished with VATS or robotic surgery. Such techniques can be used for wedge resections and segmentectomies (<strong><em>lung-sparing procedures</em></strong> are considered in patients with limited cardiopulmonary reserve), and lobectomies. These procedures are performed under general anesthesia with a DLT or a bronchial blocker to achieve OLV. The anesthesiologist needs to be aware of the potential for emergent conversion to open thoracotomy if massive bleeding ensues. The majority of thoracoscopic surgery requires placement of a chest tube with underwater seal drainage so that extubation can be performed safely.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Cryoablation in the Airway</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Lobectomy is the standard operation for the management of lung cancer because local recurrence of the tumor is reduced compared with that of lesser resections. Lobectomy is commonly performed via <strong><em>open thoracotomy</em></strong> or VATS with a DLT or a bronchial blocker. Patients undergoing lobectomy can usually be extubated in the operating room provided preoperative respiratory function is adequate.</p>
<p class="indent">Pneumonectomy is performed through an open thoracotomy. Lung isolation can be performed with a DLT, bronchial blocker, or single-lumen endobronchial tube. When using a DLT, it is optimal to use a device that does not interfere with the ipsilateral airway (ie, a left-sided DLT for a right pneumonectomy). Postoperatively, if suction is applied to a chest drain or it is connected to a standard underwater seal system, <strong><em>mediastinal shift</em></strong> may ensue with hemodynamic collapse. A postoperative chest radiograph is mandatory to assess for mediastinal shift. The mortality rate following pneumonectomy exceeds that for lobectomy because of postoperative cardiac complications and acute lung injury. The risk of complications increases fivefold in patients aged 65 years and older.<sup><a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib6">6</a></sup> The complication of cardiac herniation will be discussed in the last section of this chapter.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen628">E. Esophageal Surgery</h5>
<p class="nonindent">General considerations, which apply to almost all esophageal patients, include an increased risk of <strong><em>aspiration</em></strong> due to esophageal dysfunction and the possibility of <strong><em>malnutrition</em></strong>. Esophagectomy is a potentially curative treatment for esophageal cancer and for some benign obstructive lesions. It is a major surgical procedure and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates (10%-15%). There are multiple surgical procedures for esophagectomy that combine three fundamental approaches: transthoracic approach, transhiatal approach, and minimally invasive surgery. Outcomes are improved with early extubation, thoracic epidural analgesia, and vasopressor or inotrope infusions to support blood pressure.<sup><a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Restrictive fluid strategy for patients undergoing pulmonary and esophageal surgery has become controversial because of a concern about its potential to induce acute kidney injury.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen629">F. Tracheal Resection</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Tracheal resection is indicated in patients who have a tracheal obstruction as a result of a tracheal tumor, trauma (most commonly due to postintubation stenosis), congenital anomalies, vascular lesions, or tracheomalacia. The airways of patients with congenital or acquired tracheal stenosis are unlikely to collapse during induction of anesthesia. However, intratracheal masses may lead to <strong><em>airway obstruction</em></strong> <a id="page759"></a>with induction of anesthesia and should be managed similarly to anterior mediastinal masses (see below). A variety of methods for providing adequate ventilation have been used during tracheal resection, including standard orotracheal intubation; insertion of a sterile SLT into the opened trachea or bronchus distal to the area of resection; high-frequency jet ventilation with a catheter through the stenotic area; high-frequency PPV; and the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). After the tracheal resection is completed, most patients are kept in a position of neck flexion to reduce tension on the suture line. <strong><em>Early extubation</em></strong> in these cases is highly desirable. If a patient requires reintubation, it should be performed with a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope by advancing an SLT under direct vision over the bronchoscope to avoid damage to the repair.<sup><a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen630">G. Bronchopleural Fistula</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A bronchopleural fistula may be caused by rupture of a lung abscess, bronchus, bulla, cyst, or parenchymal tissue into the pleural space; erosion of a bronchus by carcinoma or chronic inflammatory disease; or stump dehiscence of a bronchial suture line after pulmonary resection. In patients with bullous lung disease, such as emphysema, there is a risk of bulla <strong><em>hyperinflation</em></strong> and rupture whenever PPV is used. The complications of bulla rupture can be life-threatening due to <strong><em>hemodynamic collapse</em></strong> from <strong><em>tension pneumothorax</em></strong> or inadequate ventilation due to a resultant bronchopleural fistula. If bronchial disruption occurs early in postresection patients, it can also be life-threatening. It is possible to redo the thoracotomy and resuture the bronchial stump. Late or chronic postresection disruption is managed with chest tube drainage or with the Clagett procedure, which includes open pleural drainage and the use of a muscle flap to reinforce the bronchial stump.</p>
<p class="indent">Concerns for the anesthesiologist in a patient with a bronchopleural fistula include the need for <strong><em>lung isolation</em></strong> to protect healthy lung regions, the possibility of tension pneumothorax with PPV, and the possibility of inadequate ventilation due to air leak from the fistula. Placement of a chest drain should be considered prior to induction to avoid the possibility of tension pneumothorax with PPV. A DLT is the optimal choice for airway management, as lung isolation should be performed before initiating PPV or repositioning the patient. This is most commonly performed with a modified rapid sequence induction of anesthesia and immediate fiberoptic positioning of the DLT. However, depending on the context, awake intubation maintenance of spontaneous ventilation may be used.<sup><a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen631">H. Bronchiectasis, Lung Abscess, and Empyema</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Infectious conditions, including bronchiectasis, lung abscess, and empyema, are indications for thoracic surgery, such as decortication. Anesthetic considerations for these conditions include the need for <strong><em>lung isolation</em></strong> to protect uninvolved lung regions from soiling by pus. A DLT facilitates suctioning of debris and copious secretions that are present in the trachea-bronchial tree and is less subject to dislodgement during patient movement or surgical manipulation than would be a bronchial blocker. Due to the inflammation, surgery is technically more difficult, and there is a greater risk of massive hemorrhage, particularly during decortication. Some of these patients may present with sepsis at the time of surgery. If the lung has been chronically collapsed, expansion should be done gradually to avoid the development of pulmonary edema upon re-expansion.<sup><a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen632">I. <a id="page760"></a>Mediastinal Masses</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Tumors of the anterior mediastinum include thymoma, teratoma, lymphoma, cystic hygroma, bronchogenic cyst, and thyroid tumors. Patients may require anesthesia for biopsy of these masses by mediastinoscopy or VATS, or they may require definitive resection via sternotomy or thoracotomy. Mediastinal masses may cause <strong><em>obstruction</em></strong> of <strong><em>major airways</em></strong> or vascular structures. During induction of general anesthesia, airway obstruction is the most common and feared complication. A history of <strong><em>supine dyspnea</em></strong> or cough should alert the anesthesiologist to the possibility of airway obstruction upon induction. General anesthesia and muscle relaxants will exacerbate extrinsic intrathoracic airway compression due to reduced lung volume and tracheobronchial diameters, bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, and loss of the normal transpleural pressure gradient that dilates the airways during spontaneous inspiration and minimizes the effects of extrinsic intrathoracic airway compression. It is important to note that the point of tracheobronchial compression may be in the distal airway, so it may not be bypassed by an ETT. The other major complication is cardiovascular collapse secondary to compression of the heart or major vessels. Symptoms of supine presyncope suggest vascular compression.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">In a patient with an anterior mediastinal mass, a history of supine dyspnea or cough may be predictive of airway collapse following induction of general anesthesia.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Patients who are symptomatic or have evidence of airway or cardiovascular involvement on imaging should have diagnostic procedures performed under local or regional anesthesia whenever possible. When general anesthesia is indicated, awake intubation of the trachea is a possibility in some adult patients, if imaging shows an area of noncompressed distal trachea to which the ETT can be advanced before induction. Alternatively, spontaneous ventilation should be maintained with either an inhalation induction or titration of an agent such as ketamine. If muscle relaxants are required, ventilation should first be gradually taken over manually to ensure that PPV is possible and only then can a short-acting muscle relaxant be administered.</p>
<p class="indent">Intraoperative life-threatening <strong><em>airway compression</em></strong> may respond to repositioning of the patient (it must be determined before induction if there is a position that causes less symptoms) or rigid bronchoscopy and ventilation distal to the obstruction (this means that an experienced bronchoscopist and equipment must always be immediately available in the operating room for these cases). Institution of femorofemoral CPB before induction of anesthesia is a possibility in some adult patients. The concept of CPB &#x201C;standby&#x201D; during attempted induction of anesthesia should not be considered because there is not enough time after a sudden airway collapse to establish CPB before hypoxic cerebral injury occurs.<sup><a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib9">9</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen633">J. Myasthenia Gravis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction, in which affected patients have weakness due to a decreased number of acetylcholine receptors at the motor end plate. Patients may or may not have an associated thymoma. Thymectomy is frequently performed to induce clinical remission, even in the absence of a thymoma. Thymectomy may be performed via full or partial sternotomy or a minimally invasive approach via a transcervical incision or VATS.</p>
<p class="indent">Medical treatments for myasthenia gravis include anticholinesterases, such as pyridostigmine, immunosuppressive drugs, such as steroids, and plasmapheresis. On the day of surgery, patients should continue their usual pyridostigmine dosing. Myasthenic patients are unpredictably <strong><em>resistant</em></strong> to <strong><em>succinylcholine</em></strong> and extremely <strong><em>sensitive</em></strong> to <strong><em>nondepolarizing blockers</em></strong>. Ideally, <a id="page761"></a>the use of intraoperative neuromuscular relaxation is avoided. Induction of anesthesia with propofol, remifentanil, and topical anesthesia of the airway facilitates intubation without the use of muscle relaxants. Alternatively, inhalational induction with a volatile agent may be performed. Referral for surgery early in the course of the disease, preoperative medical stabilization, and minimally invasive surgical approaches have made the need for postoperative ventilation infrequent.<sup><a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib10">10</a></sup></p>
