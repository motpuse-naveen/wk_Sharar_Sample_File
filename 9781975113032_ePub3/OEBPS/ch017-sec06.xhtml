<h5 class="h5" id="sen250">A. Multiple Sclerosis</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Multiple sclerosis (MS)</em></strong> is an inflammatory multifocal demyelinating disorder caused by autoimmune neurodegenerative changes leading to progressively irreversible neurologic deficits. The clinical course is characterized by subacute, relapsing-remitting changes that correlate to activated T-cell blood-brain barrier penetration with subsequent multifocal gray and white matter demyelination and edema (<strong><a href="#ff17-1">Figure 17.1</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">MS has a peak incidence at the age 20 to 40&#x00A0;years. Signs and symptoms can be vague or specific, usually determined by the neurologic site focally affected. Symptoms include headache, fatigue, and depression. Sensory symptoms such<a id="page368"></a> as numbness and paresthesias are common. Partial paralysis of the lower limbs is a common motor symptom that usually correlates to anterior column spinal cord lesions. Visual loss, diplopia, nystagmus, and papillary abnormalities reflect cranial nerve involvement. Diagnosis is based on history and clinical examination with reliance on magnetic resonance imaging to characterize demyelinating, often clinically silent, focal lesions. Cerebral spinal fluid may demonstrate intrathecal immunoglobulin production.</p>

<p class="indent">Management strategies are evolving to target acute relapse and symptomatic control. Corticosteroids can hasten acute clinical recovery. Plasma exchange removes harmful antibodies to treat relapses. Interferon-beta and glatiramer acetate block antigen presentation to minimize relapsing-remitting events. Mitoxantrone, an antineoplastic agent, reduces lymphocyte counts to delay progression to secondary degenerative phase. Symptomatic management is usually determined by the diffuse nature of MS. Severe fatigue is common and should be treated promptly with central nervous system stimulants, such as amantadine. Routine depression screening and early treatment are important given the propensity to affect quality of life in this disease. Spasticity treatment requires both physical therapy and antispasticity medications. Intrathecal baclofen pump implantation is reserved for severe cases. Pain is usually due to varied factors, such as neuropathic pain, indirect pain from MS, and treatment-related pain. As a result, pain management is multimodal, potentially involving antiepileptics, tricyclic antidepressants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and antispastic agents.</p>

<p class="dify">In multiple sclerosis, pain is caused by a variety of mechanisms; therefore, the best treatment is using multimodal analgesia.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen251">B. Epilepsy</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Epilepsy</em></strong> is a disorder characterized by sudden, unprovoked, and recurrent seizures. A seizure is a neurologic symptom characterized by a transient attack of rhythmic electroneuronal discharges, resulting in altered consciousness and disturbances in brain function. Seizures can be provoked by factors such as metabolic derangements, or unprovoked, by intrinsic brain disease.</p>
<p class="indent">Epilepsies and seizures are mostly clinical diagnoses with reliance on history, physical examination, laboratory testing, electroencephalography, and neuroimaging. Investigating the paroxysmal event, triggers, and recurrence potential helps exclude or confirm the diagnosis.</p>
<p class="indent">Epilepsies are broadly divided into <strong><em>focal</em></strong> and <strong><em>generalized</em></strong>. In focal epilepsies, usually localized pathologic conditions, such as brain tumors, lead to focal cortical discharges that can generalize and recruit other cortical regions. In generalized epilepsies, diffuse cortical discharges develop, affecting the cortex and bilaterally. <strong><em>Grand mal seizure</em></strong> is the most recognized type of generalized epilepsy. It is characterized by a loss of consciousness followed by several minutes of a <strong><em>tonic phase</em></strong> of body stiffening, followed by a <strong><em>clonic phase</em></strong> of repetitive contractions, and ending in a prolonged <strong><em>postictal phase</em></strong> of lethargy and return of consciousness. During the tonic phase, breath-holding, incontinence, tongue biting, tremors, and sinus tachycardia may occur. Trauma, aspiration pneumonia, and arrhythmias may also occur during these seizures. Benzodiazepines or propofol can be used to terminate seizure activity. Ventilatory support may be needed. <strong><em>Status epilepticus</em></strong> is a potentially fatal convulsive disorder marked by serial tonic-clonic phases occurring without return of consciousness. Untreated, hyperpyrexia, hypoxia, and shock can develop acutely. Multiple precipitating risk factors exist, including brain tumor and drug intoxication. Treatment goals should be supportive care, <a id="page369"></a>seizure termination, and prevention. Endotracheal intubation should be performed for airway protection. Intravenous phenytoin can be used for seizure recurrence prophylaxis. Refractory seizures may require benzodiazepine or propofol infusion; general anesthesia may even be necessary.<sup><a href="ch017-sec10.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen252">C. Alzheimer Disease</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Dementia</em></strong> is an irreversible, chronic, neurodegenerative disease marked by a constant decline in cognitive function, affecting memory, behavior, and executive function that, over time, degrades daily activities and social interaction. <strong><em>Alzheimer disease (AD)</em></strong> is the most common cause of dementia. Senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the hallmarks of AD. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are considered the first line of pharmacotherapy to treat the central cholinergic deficiency&#x2013;related cognitive decline in AD. Side effects from cholinergic stimulation during AChEI therapy include hypotension, bradycardia, and bronchoconstriction. Drug interactions with AChEI and muscle relaxants may result in prolonged paralysis with succinylcholine and resistance to muscle relaxation with <em>N</em>-methyl-<span class="usmall">D</span>-aspartates.<sup><a href="ch017-sec10.xhtml#bib6">6</a></sup></p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Parkinson Disease</strong></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen253">D. Parkinson Disease</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Parkinson disease (PD)</em></strong> is a neurodegenerative movement disorder marked by an acetylcholine-dopamine imbalance caused by loss of dopamine-producing cells within the substantia nigra. It is a clinical diagnosis confirmed by motor and nonmotor features in the absence of a pertinent drug history. Common motor features of PD are &#x201C;pill-rolling&#x201D; tremors at rest, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability, flexed posture, or incapacity to move. Nonmotor features include cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric disorders, sensory disturbances, sleep disorders, and autonomic dysfunction.</p>
<p class="indent">Medical management is determined by factors such as age of onset, symptom fluctuations, dopamine responsiveness, and end-stage disease. <strong><em>Levodopa</em></strong> remains the most effective form of oral therapy for motor symptoms. It is highly metabolized and can cause nausea and hypotension. Long-term levodopa use can result in confusion, dyskinesia, and poor symptom relief. Hepatic metabolism and peripheral side effects are commonly reduced by combining levodopa with carbidopa, a <strong><em>decarboxylase inhibitor</em></strong>. Pramipexole, ropinirole, and bromocriptine are <strong><em>dopamine agonists</em></strong> used when levodopa response decreases. Side effects include hallucinations and confusion. Selegiline and rasagiline are <strong><em>monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors</em></strong> used to augment dopamine concentrations. <strong><em>Deep brain stimulation</em></strong> via implanted generator electrodes is a surgical treatment option.</p>
