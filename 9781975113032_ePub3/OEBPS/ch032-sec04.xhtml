<h5 class="h5" id="sen554">A. Initial Evaluation and Management of Burn Injuries</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to stopping the burning process by removing clothing from the burned area, burn-injured patients merit special consideration in the primary trauma survey, given the possibility for airway involvement with thermal injury or smoke inhalation. If the patient was injured in an enclosed space (eg, house fire), has carbonaceous sputum, singed nasal hairs, or other signs suggesting <strong><em>inhalation injury</em></strong>, it is prudent to perform tracheal intubation <a id="page693"></a>early. Delaying tracheal intubation can allow airway edema to form&#x2014;particularly after significant fluid resuscitation&#x2014;and make later airway management extremely difficult. As noted in <strong><a href="ch032-sec02.xhtml#tt32-3">Table 32.3</a></strong>, succinylcholine can cause life-threatening hyperkalemia in burn-injured patients, but not until 48 to 72 hours after injury when upregulation of acetylcholine receptors occurs. Thus, either succinylcholine or rocuronium can be used for RSI in the immediate postinjury setting. Environment control and prevention of hypothermia are also essential due to patient&#x2019;s impaired ability to thermoregulate.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen555">B. Burn Severity Estimation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The magnitude of burn injury should be evaluated by estimation of depth and percentage of total body surface area (%TBSA) involved to guide treatment. Burn depths are characterized as <strong><em>superficial</em></strong> (eg, sunburn), <strong><em>partial thickness</em></strong>, or <strong><em>full thickness</em></strong>. Full-thickness burns include all layers of the epidermis and dermis and require surgical debridement. The patient&#x2019;s handprint is considered approximately 1% of the total body surface area (TBSA). For larger burns, the most common method to estimate %TBSA is the &#x201C;Rule of Nines&#x201D; (<strong><a href="#ff32-6">Figure 32.6</a></strong>). However, this method is less accurate in children and tends to overestimate in obese patients.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen556">C. <a id="page694"></a>Inhalation Injury</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to burn severity, inhalation injury is a major prognostic factor for burn victims. Aside from direct thermal and chemical irritation of the upper and lower airway, inhalation of combustion chemical byproducts can cause systemic toxicity. The most common of them are carbon monoxide and cyanide poisoning.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Even if respiratory distress is not present upon hospital arrival, patients with significant facial burns or inhalation injury should undergo early tracheal intubation when the procedure is easier to perform, rather than delay until fluid resuscitation and inflammation create a difficult airway due to massive soft tissue edema.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Carbon monoxide (CO)</em></strong> has an affinity for hemoglobin several hundred times higher than that of oxygen. Patients with CO toxicity rarely present with the classic cherry red complexion, and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry will erroneously appear normal. CO-oximetry is needed in this setting to yield accurate values for both elevated <strong><em>carboxyhemoglobin</em></strong> and reduced hemoglobin oxygen saturation. CO poisoning interferes with oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues and with cellular respiration, leading to metabolic acidosis. It is also associated with <strong><em>central demyelination</em></strong> and long-term neurologic sequelae. In cases of suspected CO poisoning, the carboxyhemoglobin level should be determined. Also, high concentration oxygen should be administered immediately as this can create a gradient that displaces CO from hemoglobin. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy can reduce the half-life of CO in the blood even further, but chambers are rarely available and pose logistic issues for other intensive and burn care.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cyanide toxicity</em></strong> can result from inhalation of combustion products, as well as prolonged use of sodium nitroprusside, leading to impaired cellular respiration and metabolic acidosis. Cyanide toxicity is treated with <strong><em>hydroxocobalamin</em></strong>; it combines with cyanide to form cyanocobalamin, which is eliminated in the urine. <strong><em>Sodium thiosulfate</em></strong> can also be administered to form thiocyanate, which is eliminated via the kidneys. Cyanide antidote kits also contain <strong><em>amyl nitrite</em></strong>, which can clear cyanide through formation of <strong><em>methemoglobin</em></strong>. Amyl nitrite is a temporizing measure that should be used only if intravenous access or hydroxocobalamin is unavailable.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen557">D. Fluid Resuscitation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Burn-injured patients develop a capillary leak syndrome at both the burn site and distal anatomic locations, resulting in intravascular fluid loss and hypovolemic shock. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is required in the first 24 hours and is guided by various crystalloid and colloid algorithms (<strong><a href="#tt32-5">Table 32.5</a></strong>), with the goal of maintaining adequate tissue perfusion. Underresuscitation can result in hypoperfusion and multiorgan failure. Conversely, overresuscitation can lead to serious complications (eg, acute lung injury, abdominal compartment syndromes). Thus, regardless of formula used, fluid resuscitation should be carefully titrated to maintain a physiologic endpoint. Urine output is commonly used with the goal of 0.5&#x00A0;mL/kg/h in adults and 1&#x00A0;mL/kg/h in children.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen558">E. Perioperative Management of Burn-Injured Patients</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Burn-injured patients require specialized perioperative care for several injury-specific risks.<sup><a href="ch032-sec05.xhtml#bib11">11</a></sup> These patients are at increased risk for hypothermia because of poor skin integrity and aggressive intravenous fluid therapy. They require special efforts to maintain their body temperature, including elevated operating room temperature and warming devices. Patients with severe inhalation injury may require special ventilation strategies (eg, high-frequency percussive ventilation) and necessitate use of the intensive care unit ventilator in the operating room. Such cases will require total intravenous anesthesia to provide hypnosis and analgesia. If neuromuscular blockade is required, succinylcholine should be avoided after 48 hours following injury, as noted previously. Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants are safe but will have shortened durations of action because of the quantitative and qualitative changes in neuromuscular acetylcholine receptors that occur in the early days following burn injury. Postoperative pain control is a major priority for the burn patient, and multimodal therapy should be considered wherever possible. Patient-controlled analgesia, regional anesthesia, opioids, gabapentin, acetaminophen, and ketamine are all options in the burn patient, and consultation with a pain specialist is often helpful.</p>
