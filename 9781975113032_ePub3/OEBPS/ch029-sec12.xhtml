<h5 class="h5" id="sen467">A. Retrobulbar, Peribulbar, and Sub-Tenon Blocks</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>1. Retrobulbar Block</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is placed supine with the eye in a neutral position. A 23 to 25 gauge needle is inserted through the lower lid or conjunctiva at the level of the inferior orbital rim in the inferotemporal quadrant (<strong><a href="#ff29-5">Figure 29.5</a></strong>). The needle is advanced toward the apex of the orbit until loss of resistance is felt (a &#x201C;pop&#x201D;). Then 4 to 6&#x00A0;mL of local anesthetic is injected within the muscle cone (four recti muscles and two oblique muscles), obtaining fast and reliable anesthesia and akinesia.</p>
<h6 class="h6">2. Peribulbar Block</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The needle is advanced along the inferior orbital floor parallel to the globe, and local anesthetics are injected in the extraconal space, diffusing to adjacent tissue. Greater amounts of local anesthetics are needed in comparison with a retrobulbar block, raising the concern for potential increases in IOP, perforation of the globe, and myotoxicity.</p>
<p class="indent">Aspiration before injection is required for both blocks, followed by gentle massage or orbital compression to promote spread of the anesthetic.</p>

<h6 class="h6">3. <a id="page617"></a>Episcleral (Sub-Tenon) Block</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Local anesthetic is injected into the episcleral space (posterior sub-Tenon space). Needle entry is into the fornix at the angle tangential to the globe, between the conjunctival semilunaris fold and globe. Upon entry into the conjunctiva, the needle is shifted medially and advanced posteriorly until a click is felt.<sup><a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib10">10</a>,<a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib16">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Complications of regional eye blocks include optic nerve trauma, brain stem anesthesia (amaurosis, gaze palsy, apnea, dilatation of the contralateral pupil, cardiac arrest), retrobulbar hemorrhage (proptosis of the eye), globe perforation, oculocardiac reflex, seizures, and myocardial depression.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen468">B. Topical Anesthesia</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Topical anesthesia includes drops or gels. Local anesthetics include proparacaine (least irritating), lidocaine, bupivacaine, and tetracaine.<sup><a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib10">10</a>,<a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib16">16</a></sup> Benefits of topical anesthesia include no risk of hemorrhage, brainstem anesthesia, optic nerve damage, or perforation of the globe. Disadvantages include lack of akinesia and limited use for cataract surgery.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen469">C. Choice of Local Anesthetic, Block Adjuvants, and Adjuncts</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The anesthetic approach for ophthalmologic surgery is based on the procedure length and type. Topical anesthesia combines local anesthetics and vasoconstrictors. Vasoconstrictors delay the washout of local anesthetics, prolonging their action.</p>
<p class="indent">Adjuvants like clonidine, sodium bicarbonate, morphine sulfate, vecuronium, and hyaluronidase (increased tissue permeability) may also be used to prolong the duration of the blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">Increased IOP after administration of local anesthetics can be reduced with the aid of IV osmotic agents or mechanical devices to compress the globe. Mechanical devices may compromise blood flow and result in ischemic optic neuropathy or central retinal artery occlusion.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen470">D. Monitored Anesthesia Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of this type of sedation exclusively are to provide deep sedation during the administration of regional anesthesia and to otherwise keep the patient comfortable during the remainder of the procedure. The patient should be responsive, cooperative, and able to protect the airway.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen471">E. General Anesthesia for Ophthalmic Surgery</h5>
<p class="nonindent">General anesthesia is indicated for procedures that require an immobile surgical field or for patients unable to lie still. Emergence should be smooth, with minimal coughing, bucking, or gagging, in order to minimize elevations in IOP. Patient should be spontaneously breathing, and prophylaxis with opioids or lidocaine to blunt the cough reflex may be administered prior to extubation.<sup><a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib10">10</a>,<a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib16">16</a></sup></p>
