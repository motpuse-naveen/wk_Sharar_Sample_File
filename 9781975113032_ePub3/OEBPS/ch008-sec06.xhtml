<p class="nonindent">Inhaled anesthetics other than nitrous oxide directly relax skeletal muscles; this effect depends on the dose administered. They also potentiate the actions of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs. All inhaled anesthetics other than nitrous oxide and xenon can precipitate malignant hyperthermia in susceptible patients.</p>
<p class="indent">All volatile inhaled anesthetics directly depress uterine muscle tone in a dose-dependent fashion similar to vascular smooth muscle. This can contribute to<a id="page159"></a> excessive uterine bleeding for women undergoing cesarean delivery or a therapeutic abortion, when the concentration of anesthetic exceeds 1 MAC. The anesthetic will also affect the newborn infant in terms of wakefulness, but the effect is short lived. It is common practice to administer lower concentrations of inhaled anesthetics (0.5-0.75 MAC) along with nitrous oxide when general anesthesia is necessary for cesarean delivery. In contrast, the uterine relaxant effects of volatile anesthetics may be desirable in patients with a retained placenta.</p>

<p class="indent">Some older inhaled anesthetics are known to decrease liver blood flow. However, the new ether-based anesthetics (isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane) maintain or increase hepatic artery blood flow while decreasing or not changing portal vein blood flow. Rarely, patients may develop hepatitis secondary to exposure of an inhaled anesthetic, most notably from halothane (halothane hepatitis), which is an immune-mediated reaction to oxidatively<a id="page160"></a> derived metabolites of the anesthetic. Inhaled anesthetics may cause a decrease in renal blood flow as a result of decreased cardiac output and blood pressure or an increase in renal vascular resistance.</p>
