<p class="nonindent">Laparoscopic surgical techniques have significant benefits over the traditional open approach, including smaller incisions, decreased postoperative pain, faster recovery time, and reduced chance of blood transfusion and wound infection. Potential disadvantages include higher risk of inadvertent vascular and major organ puncture during placement of the access ports as compared with the traditional open approach. Recently, robot-assisted laparoscopy has been introduced to address some of the disadvantages of laparoscopy, including surgeon fatigue, hand tremor, poor ergonomics, and difficult visualization and manipulation of instruments while retaining all the advantages of laparoscopic techniques.<sup><a href="ch027-sec08.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> Specific disadvantages pertain to the quality and consistency of data connection between the surgeon and the robot and to the high cost of robot-assisted procedures. This chapter reviews laparoscopic and robot-assisted laparoscopic techniques, their physiologic impact on the patient, and the essential perioperative management strategies for patients undergoing these procedures.</p>
