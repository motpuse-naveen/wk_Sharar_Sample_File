<h4 class="h4" id="sec234">I. Vascular Disease: Epidemiologic, Medical, and Surgical Aspects</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The incidence of atherosclerosis and vascular disease increases with advancing age. Therefore, it can be expected that there will be higher demand for vascular procedures, especially novel techniques such as angioplasty and endovascular stent placement. In addition, patients undergoing vascular surgery are some of the most complex patients to manage in the perioperative period. This chapter will focus on the principles of that management.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen656">A. Pathophysiology of Atherosclerosis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Atherosclerosis describes a multifactorial <strong><em>inflammatory disease</em></strong> of the vascular tree. Predisposing risk factors for atherosclerosis include hypertension, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, cigarette smoking, increasing age, family history, pro-inflammatory states, and prothrombotic states. The development of atherosclerosis occurs in two stages: endothelial injury and inflammatory response to injury. The primary injury occurs as low-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B&#x2013;containing lipoproteins invade the vascular endothelium and become pro-inflammatory. As the inflammatory cascade ensues, the subendothelial space is filled with atherogenic lipoproteins and macrophages, which form foam cells. Foam cells form the atheromatous core of a plaque, which becomes necrotic and further enhances the inflammatory process. Disruption of the fibrous cap over a lipid deposit can lead to plaque rupture and ulceration. Vascular disease is not a localized phenomenon, but rather a systemic one affecting multiple organs including the heart with myocardial infarction (MI) and the brain with cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen657">B. Natural History of Patients With Peripheral Vascular Disease</h5>
<p class="nonindent">More than 25 million people in the United States have clinical manifestations of atherosclerotic vascular disease (<strong><a href="#ff37-1">Figure 37.1</a></strong>). For example, 43% of men and 34% of women older than 65&#x00A0;years have &#x003E;25% carotid stenosis, and stroke remains the leading cause of disability and the third leading cause of death in the United States. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) can cause claudication and limb ischemia (2% prevalence in aging individuals). Aortic atherosclerotic disease can lead to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), aortic dissection, peripheral atheroembolism, penetrating aortic ulcer, and intramural hematoma. Coronary atherosclerosis that leads to MI is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen658">C. Medical Therapy for Atherosclerosis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Management of contributing systemic diseases such as <strong><em>hypertension</em></strong> (using antihypertensives such as beta blockers), <strong><em>hyperlipidemia</em></strong> (using statins or other lipid-lowering agents), <strong><em>diabetes</em></strong> (using oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin therapy), and obesity (through exercise, weight loss, and diet) may significantly retard the progression of atherosclerosis and may reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality after vascular surgery. Treatment with statin drugs reduces progression and may cause regression of atherosclerotic plaques, improve endothelial function, and reduce cardiovascular events. Chronic therapy with aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and especially smoking cessation have all been shown to significantly slow or reverse the progression of atherosclerosis. Most <strong><em>medical therapies</em></strong>, including statins, aspirin, and <em>&#x03B2;</em> blockers, should be continued up to and throughout the perioperative period to reduce the risk of perioperative cardiovascular events (<strong><a href="ch037-sec02.xhtml#tt37-1">Table 37.1</a></strong>).</p>
