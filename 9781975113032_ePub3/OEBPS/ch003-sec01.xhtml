<p class="nonindent">The normal adult heart is about the size of a fist, weighs approximately 300&#x00A0;g, and has a trapezoid shape with its apex oriented leftward and anterior in the chest (<strong><a href="#ff3-1">Figure 3.1</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch003-sec10.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> The anterior thoracic surface projections of the heart and great vessels, relative to the bony ribs, sternum, and xiphoid process, are shown in <strong><a href="#ff3-2">Figure 3.2</a></strong>. As the central &#x201C;pump&#x201D; of the human body, it contracts about 100,000 times per day and propels blood into the pulmonary and systemic circulations. The right and the left chambers are anatomically separated by septa. Only in the fetal circulation or in the setting of certain pathologies (eg, atrial or ventricular septal defects) is there direct communication of blood flow between the right and left sides. On each side, blood first returns from the venous circulation into a thin-walled atrium. It then flows through an <strong><em>atrioventricular</em></strong> (AV) <strong><em>valve</em></strong> into a muscular ventricle, and finally through a <strong><em>semilunar valve</em></strong> into the great arteries&#x2014;the <strong>aorta</strong> on the left and the <strong><em>pulmonary artery</em></strong> (PA) on the right (<strong><a href="#ff3-3">Figure 3.3</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><em>heart wall</em></strong> has three layers: the thin, inner endocardium; the thick, middle myocardium; and the outer epicardium (ie, the visceral pericardium). The myocardium is anchored to the cardiac <strong><em>fibrous skeleton</em></strong>, a system of dense collagen forming two rings and connective trigones that separate the atria and ventricles to prevent uncontrolled conduction of electrical impulses and also serve as anchors for the AV valves.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><em>right atrium</em></strong> (RA), <strong><em>superior vena cava</em></strong> (SVC), and <strong><em>inferior vena cava</em></strong> (IVC) form the right lateral border of the heart. Venous return from the heart itself enters the RA through the <strong><em>coronary sinus</em></strong> (CS), which collects blood from the major cardiac veins. The internal wall of the RA includes the right-sided wall of the <strong><em>interatrial septum</em></strong> (IAS). The center of the IAS features the fossa ovalis, a small groove that is a remnant of the foramen ovale. In the fetal circulation, it allows for oxygenated blood to flow from the right-sided to the left-sided circulation. It usually closes after birth, but remains patent in 25% to 30% of the population.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><em>right ventricle</em></strong> (RV) forms most of the anterior surface of the heart and some of its inferior surface and has about a sixth of the muscle mass of the <strong><em>left ventricle</em></strong> (LV). The muscular <strong><em>interventricular septum</em></strong> (IVS) functions as a contractile wall for both the RV and the LV.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><em>tricuspid valve</em></strong> (TV) has three distinct leaflets (anterior, septal, and posterior) that are attached to tendinous cords. It connects to papillary muscles that tighten to draw the valve cusp edges together in ventricular systole and prevent regurgitant flow through this AV valve. The RV wall is heavily trabeculated, with one prominent trabecula (moderator band) connecting the IVS with the anterior RV wall. It houses the right branch of the AV conduction bundle (see below).</p>

<p class="indent">The <strong><em>pulmonic valve</em></strong> (PV) is a semilunar valve with three defined cusps (anterior, left, right) that are pushed toward the wall of the <strong><em>right ventricular outflow tract</em></strong> (RVOT) with ventricular contraction in systole. After relaxation in diastole, the cusps close like an umbrella to prevent regurgitation. The main PA quickly bifurcates into right and left branches that deliver deoxygenated blood to the pulmonary circulation for subsequent gas exchange.</p>
<p class="indent">Oxygenated blood returning from the lungs enters the <strong><em>left atrium</em></strong> (LA) through four pulmonary veins, normally two originating from each lung. The LA forms the majority of the base of the heart, with the small LA appendage as part of its anterolateral wall. The IAS has a small semilunar indentation representing the left-sided aspect of the oval fossa.</p>
<p class="indent">The LV forms the apex of the heart, as well as most of its left (lateral) and diaphragmatic (inferior) surfaces, and its normal maximal wall thickness is 10&#x00A0;mm (compared with 3&#x00A0;mm in the RV). The IVS is concave to the highly trabeculated LV wall, resulting in an almost circular LV chamber on anatomic cross-section.</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike the right-sided TV, the left-sided AV <strong><em>mitral valve</em></strong> (MV) is bicuspid, with anterior and posterior leaflets that are connected to anterolateral and posteromedial papillary muscles by tendinous cords similar to those of the TV. Both MV leaflets receive cords from papillary muscles that keep this valve shut in the setting of high intraventricular pressure during systole.</p>
<p class="indent">The inflow and outflow tracts of the LV lie almost parallel to each other, with the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve forming a natural separation between these two structures. The wall of the <strong><em>left ventricular outflow tract</em></strong> (LVOT) is smooth, round to oval in shape, and contains the <strong><em>aortic valve</em></strong> through which blood enters the systemic circulation. This valve has three distinct cusps named after the presence or absence of coronary artery ostia originating from the sinuses of Valsalva just above the valve: the left coronary, right coronary, and noncoronary cusps (<strong><a href="#ff3-4">Figure 3.4</a></strong>).</p>

<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Coronary artery anatomy is termed either right dominant or left dominant, depending on which main coronary artery feeds the posterior descending branch (in the interventricular groove) to the posteroinferior surface of the heart. Right-dominant circulation is most common, found in 70% of the population.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The coronary vasculature consists of the <strong><em>coronary arteries</em></strong> (<strong><a href="#ff3-5">Figure 3.5</a></strong>) and the CS (described earlier). The arteries carry blood to most of the myocardium except the subendocardial layers, which receive oxygen directly via diffusion from blood inside the cardiac chambers. The <strong><em>left coronary artery</em></strong> (LCA) and the <strong><em>right coronary artery</em></strong> (RCA) arise from the respective sinuses in the proximal aorta. The RCA travels to the right of the PA in the AV groove and sends branches to the <strong><em>sinoatrial</em></strong> (SA) <strong><em>node</em></strong> (inside the RA wall) and to the right border of the heart. The RCA continues posteriorly in the AV groove and sends a branch to the AV node of the conducting system before entering the posterior interventricular groove. When the RCA continues down that groove to form the posterior interventricular branch, this is termed <strong><em>right-dominant</em></strong> circulation (&#x223C;70% of individuals). The LCA travels between the PA and the LA appendage and splits early in its course into the <strong><em>left anterior descending</em></strong> (LAD) artery and the circumflex branch. The LAD continues in the anterior interventricular groove all the way to the LV apex and around the inferior aspect of the heart where it often forms anastomoses with the branches of the posterior interventricular branch. The LAD also sends many septal branches to the IVS throughout its course, as well as prominent diagonal branch to<a id="page45"></a> the lateral wall. When the circumflex branch gives rise to the posterior interventricular branch, this is termed <strong><em>left-dominant</em></strong> circulation (&#x223C;30% of individuals). Such variable coronary artery anatomy is important when trying to understand the relation between coronary artery disease and regional dysfunction of ischemic myocardium.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff3-4"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff3-4.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="caption"><span class="fignum">Figure&#160;3.4</span> Relation between the aortic valve cusps and the coronary arteries. Like the pulmonary valve, the aortic valve has three semilunar cusps: right, posterior, and left. During systole, ejected blood forces the cusps apart. During diastole, the cusps close and coronary artery flow occurs. (From Thorax. In: Moore KL, Agur AMR, Dalley II AF, eds. <em>Clinically Oriented Anatomy</em>. 8th ed. Wolters Kluwer; 2018:290-403, Figure 4.59A.)</figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Normal <strong><em>electrical conduction</em></strong> is initiated by an electrical impulse generated in the SA node, a locus of specialized cardiac cells in the RA wall that have no contractile function. As the pacemaker center of the heart, the SA node autonomically generates an impulse at about 60 to 80 beats per minute. From the SA node, bundles of cells lead to the AV node located above the right fibrous trigone of the heart at the AV border. From the AV node, the impulse is conducted via the AV bundle, also known as the <strong><em>bundle of His</em></strong>, that pierces the fibrous skeleton of the heart and splits just above the muscular IVS into right and left bundles. The right bundle continues toward the apex of the heart and then splits into smaller subendocardial RV branches. The left bundle splits close to its origin into a left anterior and a left posterior branch, which then further split into subendocardial LV branches near the apex of the heart (<strong><a href="#ff3-6">Figure 3.6</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><em>pericardium</em></strong> is a double-layered sac around the heart. The visceral serous layer (epicardium) covers most of the heart&#x2019;s surface. It extends to and reflects at the proximal portion of the great vessels and turns into the parietal pericardial sac. Between the two layers, a small amount of fluid is considered physiologic. The pericardium protects and restrains the heart, reduces friction associated with its constant movement within the mediastinum, and separates the heart and origin of the great vessels from other structures inside the mediastinum. Abnormal pericardial fluid collections (eg, pericardial tamponade) can be accessed and withdrawn as described in <strong><a href="#ff3-2">Figure 3.2</a></strong>.</p>
