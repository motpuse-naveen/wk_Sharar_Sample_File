<h4 class="h4" id="sec14">VII. Ventilation and Perfusion</h4>
<p class="nonindent">In order for gas exchange to occur, ventilated alveoli must be exposed to blood within pulmonary capillaries. Physiologically, lungs are heterogeneous. Alveoli are exposed to varying amounts of ventilation and perfusion.<sup><a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib11">11</a></sup> However, the matching of ventilation and perfusion is paramount to oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen29">A. Ventilation and Perfusion Distribution</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Ventilation distribution within the lung depends on the compliance of alveoli and the relative distending pressure. Theoretically, the pressure within all the alveoli in the lung is constant, but the pressure outside the alveoli is heterogeneous throughout the lung, resulting in different-sized alveoli (<strong><a href="#ff2-8">Figure 2.8</a></strong>). In the upright position, alveoli are resting at larger inflated volumes at the apex compared with the base of the lung secondary to greater compression from gravitational pressure of alveoli at the base. The alveoli at the base are relatively less inflated; however, at rest, they are more compliant. As the lungs are inflated, the basal alveoli receive more ventilation because they are at a more compliant point than apical alveoli and the distending pressure is greater.<a id="page25"></a> Ventilation distribution is also affected by anatomy and flow rates. Central regions of the lung are preferentially ventilated, but as flow rates are increased, this ventilatory difference is minimized. Simply stated, during spontaneous ventilation, more gas is distributed to gravity-dependent areas.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff2-8"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff2-8.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="caption"><span class="fignum">Figure&#160;2.8</span> Ventilation distribution. Apical alveoli are distended compared with basal alveoli at rest secondary to greater compressive force at the base of the lung, as depicted by the three different alveolar positions at rest. The less distended basal alveoli are therefore resting at a more compliant position than the distended apical alveoli. With inspiration, the basal alveoli are exposed to greater ventilation, while the apical alveoli see minimal ventilation, as illustrated by the change in distention between the alveoli from rest to inspiration.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Alveolar perfusion is also heterogeneous in the lung and depends mainly on gravity (<strong><a href="#ff2-9">Figure 2.9</a></strong>). Gravity increases the flow of blood to dependent areas. West et al<sup><a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib12">12</a></sup> divided the lung into three zones based on relative alveolar pressure (<em>P</em><sub>A</sub>), pulmonary artery pressure (<em>P</em><sub>a</sub>), and pulmonary venous pressure (<em>P</em><sub>v</sub>). Physiologically, the pulmonary artery pressure must always exceed pulmonary venous pressure; the zones are described by the degree of alveolar pressure in relation to pulmonary artery and venous pressure. Perfusion depends on the relative resistance to the pulmonary artery pressure in each of the zones. Zone 1 is the area of the lung in which <em>P</em><sub>A</sub>&#x00A0;&#x003E;&#x00A0;<em>P</em><sub>a</sub>&#x00A0;&#x003E;&#x00A0;<em>P</em><sub>v</sub> and is found in the least gravity-dependent area of the lung. The pulmonary artery pressure is low enough that the alveolar pressure can result in pulmonary capillary compression, limiting perfusion. Zone 2 occurs where <em>P</em><sub>a</sub>&#x00A0;&#x003E;&#x00A0;<em>P</em><sub>A</sub>&#x00A0;&#x003E;&#x00A0;<em>P</em><sub>v</sub>. Fortunately, this zone comprises most of the lung, allowing for matching of perfusion and ventilation. Perfusion in zone 2 is determined by the relative pressure difference between pulmonary artery and alveolar pressure. Zone 3 exists in the most gravity-dependent area where <em>P</em><sub>a</sub>&#x00A0;&#x003E;&#x00A0;<em>P</em><sub>v</sub>&#x00A0;&#x003E;&#x00A0;<em>P</em><sub>A</sub>. In zone 3, perfusion depends on the pulmonary artery and venous pressure gradient. Anatomy also affects the perfusion of the lung. Areas of the lung exposed to greater pulmonary pressures tend to be anatomically closer to the source of pulmonary perfusion, the pulmonary artery. Again, like ventilation, perfusion is greater at gravity-dependent areas.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen30">B. Ventilation and Perfusion Relationship</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Matching ventilation with perfusion is vital to ensuring carbon dioxide and oxygen gas exchange. Ideally, ventilation would be perfectly matched with perfusion, optimizing the possibility for gas diffusion across the alveolar and<a id="page26"></a> pulmonary capillary membranes. The distribution of ventilation and perfusion, however, is heterogeneous in the lung, resulting in mismatches of ventilation and perfusion (<strong><a href="#ff2-10">Figure 2.10</a></strong>). Mismatches in ventilation and perfusion routinely occur along a continuum.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff2-9"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff2-9.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="caption"><span class="fignum">Figure&#160;2.9</span> Perfusion distribution is heterogeneous throughout the lung. Font size indicates the relative alveolar pressure (<em>P</em><sub>A</sub>), pulmonary arterial pressure (<em>P</em><sub>a</sub>), and pulmonary venous pressure (<em>P</em><sub>v</sub>). At the apex, <em>P</em><sub>A</sub> is greater than <em>P</em><sub>a</sub> and <em>P</em><sub>v</sub>, limiting perfusion as illustrated by the compression of the red capillary resulting in zone 1. At the base, <em>P</em><sub>a</sub> and <em>P</em><sub>v</sub> are greater than <em>P</em><sub>A</sub>, resulting in increased perfusion as depicted by the dilated red capillary resulting in zone 3. <em>P</em><sub>A</sub> is between <em>P</em><sub>a</sub> and <em>P</em><sub>v</sub> in zone 2.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Ventilation in the excess of perfusion is termed <strong><em>dead space</em></strong>. Dead space is the portion of ventilation inadequately exposed to perfusion, primarily altering carbon dioxide elimination. Dead space can be absolute if the ventilation<a id="page27"></a> is exposed to no perfusion or relative when the ventilation is exposed to poor perfusion. Dead space is a combination of anatomical and alveolar dead space. <strong><em>Anatomical dead space</em></strong>, an absolute dead space, is the portion of ventilation to structures that are incapable of gas exchange, such as the pharynx, trachea, and large airways. Typically, anatomical dead space is approximately 2&#x00A0;mL/kg. Anatomically, ventilation must first supply anatomical dead space as it is a conduit for gas travel to the alveoli, resulting in an increased proportion of dead space ventilation with decreases in tidal volume. <strong><em>Alveolar dead space</em></strong>, which can be both absolute and relative, consists of ventilation to alveoli with suboptimal perfusion exposure. Approximately one-third of minute ventilation in spontaneously ventilating individuals is dead space. With positive pressure ventilation, dead space ventilation may further increase.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff2-10"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff2-10.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="caption"><span class="fignum">Figure&#160;2.10</span> Ventilation perfusion matching. Both ventilation and perfusion of alveoli increase at the base compared with the apex, but the rate of increase is greater for perfusion than for ventilation, with progression to the base of the lung. The intersection point indicates where ventilation and perfusion are evenly matched. The area to the right of the intersection point is relative dead space, and the area to the left of the intersection point is relative shunt.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Increased dead space ventilation is a result of either increased ventilation in poorly perfused alveoli, decreases in perfusion locally or globally, or both. Dead space ventilation most often is increased secondary to decreased cardiac output, which results in decreased pulmonary perfusion. Pulmonary perfusion can also be decreased by embolic phenomenon in the pulmonary vasculature. A routine assessment of dead space ventilation is a comparison of end-tidal carbon dioxide and arterial carbon dioxide. If ventilation and perfusion were perfectly matched, end-tidal carbon dioxide and arterial carbon dioxide would, for clinical purposes, be equal as all the ventilated gas would equilibrate with the arterial carbon dioxide. As some of the ventilated gas are not exposed to capillaries carrying carbon dioxide, dead space gas picks up negligible carbon dioxide. This gas returning from under/nonperfused alveoli dilutes the carbon dioxide from the perfusion-exposed ventilation and results in a gradient between alveolar and end-tidal carbon dioxide. As the gradient between end-tidal carbon dioxide to arterial carbon dioxide increases, concerns for pulmonary perfusion are raised. Dead space ventilation is most often a consequence of decreased perfusion when ventilation is stable. Thus, changes in dead space ventilation should be evaluated for changes in cardiac output and pulmonary perfusion.</p>
<p class="indent">Perfusion in excess of ventilation is termed <strong><em>shunt</em></strong>. Shunt is the portion of perfusion inadequately exposed to ventilated alveoli and primarily affects oxygenation. Like dead space, shunt may be absolute if the capillary blood flow is exposed to no ventilation or relative if exposed to inadequate ventilation. Relative shunt is also referred to as venous admixture. Normal absolute anatomical shunt is approximately 5% of cardiac output. This results from pleural and bronchial, veins that drain structures of the lung, and Thebesian veins that drain the endocardium, but do not participate in gas exchange with the alveoli. Shunt, both absolute and relative, may also be secondary to pathologic states, such as atelectasis, pulmonary edema, and pneumonia. Shunt is the most common cause of poor oxygenation. Arterial oxygen saturation, however, cannot be used as an assessment for shunt. It does not incorporate the effect of mixed venous blood, the blood that leaves the right heart for gas exchange. If blood leaving the right heart has high oxygen saturation, shunt could be underestimated as this blood would need minimal oxygenation to appear normal. Shunt is better assessed by comparing arterial oxygen and mixed venous saturation levels, requiring a pulmonary artery catheter. Placement of a pulmonary artery catheter is not without consequence. Health care providers often rely on clinical acumen to determine the cause of poor oxygenation, realizing that shunt is often the causative pathophysiology.</p>

<p class="indent">Ventilation and perfusion matching is critical. Physiologic mechanisms help to optimize matching. Hypocapnic pulmonary bronchoconstriction is provoked by low carbon dioxide. Dead space ventilation results in low carbon dioxide levels. Bronchoconstriction of dead space airways diverts ventilation to areas with better perfusion, decreasing dead space ventilation. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is triggered by low oxygen levels as seen with shunt. Vasoconstriction of shunt pulmonary vasculature diverts blood to better-ventilated regions, decreasing shunt. Hypocapnic pulmonary bronchoconstriction decreases dead space ventilation by decreasing ventilation in lung regions with poor perfusion. Pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction decreases shunt by decreasing perfusion to lung areas with poor ventilation. These processes help to improve ventilation and perfusion matching.</p>
