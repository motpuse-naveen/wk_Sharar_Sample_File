<p class="nonindent">The value of inhaled gases as effective pain relievers was discovered in the 1840s. Nitrous oxide was effective for analgesia and sedation, whereas diethyl ether could produce general anesthesia. On October 16, 1846, William T. G. Morton successfully demonstrated the anesthetic effects of ether at a public gathering in Massachusetts General Hospital, which was the beginning of the era of anesthesia. Since then, several pure gases and volatile anesthetics (liquids that have been vaporized to be inhaled) have been synthesized, studied, and used in clinical practice.</p>
