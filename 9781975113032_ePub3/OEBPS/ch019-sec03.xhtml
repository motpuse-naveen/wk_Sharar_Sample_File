<h4 class="h4" id="sec117">III. Intraoperative Management</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Although complications can occur at any time during an anesthetic, <strong><em>induction</em></strong> and <strong><em>emergence</em></strong> are especially fraught. During induction, the anesthesiologist administers drugs that render the patient unconscious and have significant cardiac and respiratory effects. Anesthetics can lower the patient&#x2019;s blood pressure <a id="page407"></a>by dilating arteries and (mostly) veins, depressing cardiac function, or both. Unconscious patients have diminished upper airway muscle tone, which can obstruct breathing. Many anesthetics act at the brainstem to decrease respiratory drive. Paralytic agents directly affect respiratory muscles. The anesthesiologist gauges and mitigates these effects with careful monitoring and appropriate interventions.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen296">A. Monitoring</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Because most anesthetics depress cardiorespiratory function and surgery can increase heart rate and blood pressure, anesthesiologists use both noninvasive and invasive methods to monitor the patient. The most important of these monitors are looking at the patient to help assess oxygenation and perfusion; listening to breath sounds to detect airway problems, bronchospasm, and pulmonary edema; and touching the patient&#x2019;s skin for clues about perfusion and body temperature.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Routine noninvasive monitors</em></strong> include electrocardiogram, blood pressure, pulse oximetry, capnography, and temperature. The electrocardiogram provides information about cardiac rate and rhythm and may detect myocardial ischemia. Blood pressure can vary depending on the depth of anesthesia, the degree of surgical stimulation, and the patient&#x2019;s volume status. Pulse oximetry provides critical information about the adequacy of oxygenation and detects the presence of pulsatile blood flow. Capnometry and capnography detect the presence and adequacy of ventilation. Lastly, changes in body temperature occur routinely during anesthesia, and hypo- and hyperthermia are possible (<strong><a href="#ff19-1">Figure 19.1</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">When paralytic agents are used during an anesthetic, neuromuscular function should be evaluated with a <strong><em>twitch monitor</em></strong>. This device consists of a pair of electrodes placed over a motor nerve (usually the ulnar or facial nerve). The electrodes are connected to a device that delivers a reproducible electrical stimulus. The most commonly used stimulus pattern is called a train-of-four (TOF), consisting of four equal pulses delivered at half-second intervals. In patients with normal neuromuscular function, these four pulses will elicit four equal muscular twitches. Stimulating the ulnar nerve will trigger finger flexion and thumb adduction. If the electrodes are on the facial nerve, the orbicularis oculi muscle causes the patient to wink. During onset of muscle paralysis, all four twitches will decrease at the same time and may completely disappear. As the effects of the nondepolarizing muscle relaxant begin to wane, the twitches reappear in a different pattern. Initially, only the first twitch appears. As neuromuscular function recovers further, the other twitches reappear. However, the first twitch (T1) is stronger than the subsequent twitches. The ratio of the fourth twitch (T4) to T1 is a measure of neuromuscular function. When T4:T1 is &#x2265;0.9, the patient should be able to breathe normally and have intact upper airway reflexes (see <a href="ch011.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>). Incomplete recovery of neuromuscular function happens in approximately 30% of young and 60% of elderly individuals and is associated with hypoxemia, airway obstruction, and an increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications.<sup><a href="ch019-sec05.xhtml#bib4">4</a>,<a href="ch019-sec05.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Some operations risk major blood loss. Hemodynamically unstable patients can be sensitive to the effects of anesthetic drugs. In these situations, the anesthesiologist may choose invasive methods such as intra-arterial catheters for blood pressure monitoring, central venous or pulmonary artery catheters to follow changes in blood volume and cardiac output, and transesophageal echocardiography to evaluate cardiac filling and function.</p>

<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Using a train-of-four stimulus pattern during the onset of muscle paralysis with a nondepolarizing agent, all four twitches decrease or disappear at the same time. However, as the muscle relaxant effects wear off, the twitches reappear gradually beginning with only one twitch.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen297">B. Time Out</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Wrong-site, wrong-side, and wrong-patient surgeries still occur. A universal protocol has been developed by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and numerous professional organizations to help prevent these errors. Although each institution will have its own version of the <strong><em>universal protocol</em></strong>, three elements remain standard. First, a preprocedure verification confirms the patient&#x2019;s identity, the type of surgery, and the site or side of the procedure. Second, the physician performing the surgery or procedure places a clearly visible, distinctive marking on the site of incision. Lastly, a &#x201C;time out&#x201D; occurs immediately before beginning the procedure to confirm that steps one and two have been performed correctly and the incision is about to occur at the correct site and side.</p>
<p class="indent">The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a checklist, &#x201C;the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist&#x201D; (<strong><a href="#ff19-2">Figure 19.2</a></strong>), for use in operating rooms worldwide to increase safety and reliability. Implementation of this checklist may decrease surgical complications and deaths. Poor implementation and incomplete compliance with a surgical safety checklist may limit its benefits.<sup><a href="ch019-sec05.xhtml#bib6">6</a>-<a href="ch019-sec05.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup> Many hospitals have expanded their universal protocol to include some iteration of this surgical safety checklist. There are two key elements that help<a id="page409"></a> ensure successful use of the universal protocol and the surgical safety checklist. First, everyone in the operating room stops whatever they are doing and actively participates. Second, <strong><em>anyone</em></strong> in the room can stop the process and voice questions or concerns.</p>

<p class="indent">Several organizations, including the United States Food and Drug Administration, the Joint Commission and the Association of Perioperative Registered Nurses (AORN), have recently emphasized the dangers of surgical fires. A surgical fire can occur when three specific elements are present: an oxidizer (oxygen or nitrous oxide), an ignition source (electrocautery devices, lasers, and fiber-optic illumination systems), and a fuel source (surgical drapes, alcohol-based skin preparations, or the patient&#x2019;s tissue, hair, or skin). Including a Fire Risk Assessment (<strong><a href="#ff19-3">Figure 19.3</a></strong>) in the time out/universal protocol can alert the surgical team to the degree of fire risk and allow advanced preparations to prevent and treat surgical fires.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen298">C. Induction</h5>
<p class="nonindent">General anesthesia begins with induction. Babies and small children commonly undergo an inhalation induction (see <a href="ch033.xhtml">Chapter 33</a>). Here, the patient breathes increasing amounts of anesthetic through a facemask until he or she becomes unconscious. This approach avoids the need for intravenous access while the child is awake. Inhalation induction can also be used in adults. It may be chosen for patients who are needle phobic or those with poor peripheral venous access.</p>
<p class="indent">Because intravenous induction is rapid and reliable, it is the more common choice for older children and adults. The anesthetist usually injects a<a id="page410"></a> combination of drugs chosen to quickly anesthetize the patient and provide optimal conditions for airway management and surgery. Today, propofol is the most commonly used intravenous induction agent. This drug has a rapid onset (&#x003C;60 seconds). Small doses provide sedation and anxiolysis. Larger doses cause loss of consciousness. The patient will remain unconscious for 3 to 5 minutes after an induction dose of propofol. Other induction agents include methohexital, etomidate, and ketamine (<strong><a href="#tt19-5">Table 19.5</a></strong>).</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Drawing Medication From a Vial</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Propofol often burns when injected and does a poor job of blunting the hemodynamic responses to painful stimuli like endotracheal intubation. Intravenous lidocaine can dull the burning and limit the blood pressure and heart rate response to laryngoscopy and intubation. Fast-acting opioids like fentanyl, sufentanil, or remifentanil also are effective at blocking the cardiovascular responses to laryngoscopy and surgery. Less commonly, <strong><em>&#x03B2;</em></strong><strong><em>-adrenergic blocking drugs</em></strong> also can be used for this purpose.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Torn Endotracheal Tube Cuff</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Some operations require endotracheal intubation and skeletal muscle relaxation. In commonly used doses, propofol does not induce skeletal muscle relaxation. So, after the patient loses consciousness, the anesthetist will often inject a paralytic agent (<strong><a href="#tt19-6">Table 19.6</a></strong>). These drugs act at the neuromuscular junction to produce muscle weakness or total paralysis.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen299">D. Airway</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Anesthetics impair respiration in many ways. Sedatives like midazolam and propofol relax oropharyngeal muscles and can produce airway obstruction, especially in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Opioids, like fentanyl, and potent inhaled agents, like sevoflurane, depress the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide. Patients who receive propofol and fentanyl often stop breathing altogether. Potent inhaled agents may also obliterate the respiratory response to hypoxemia. <strong><em>Paralytic drugs</em></strong>, such as succinylcholine and rocuronium, relax oropharyngeal muscles, impair airway protective reflexes, and can paralyze respiratory muscles. For these reasons, the anesthetist must be ready to assist or control the patient&#x2019;s breathing.</p>
<p class="video"><video data-id="SxrcF26B" controls="controls" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video></p>
<p class="video1" id="vid19-4"><strong>VIDEO 19.4</strong></p>
<p class="video2"><strong>Nitrogen Expansion During Cryoablation</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Because of these effects on the airway and respiration, patients usually breathe 100% oxygen for a few minutes before induction of anesthesia. This step, used to replace the nitrogen in a patient&#x2019;s lungs with oxygen, is called <strong><em>preoxygenation</em></strong> or <strong><em>denitrogenation</em></strong><em>.</em> This extra oxygen in the patient&#x2019;s lungs helps maintain oxygenation of the blood during the periods of apnea and airway obstruction that can occur during induction of anesthesia. In normal circumstances, the anesthetist will allow 3 minutes for complete denitrogenation. However, in emergencies, four tidal breaths of 100% oxygen will suffice.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Preoxygenation is also referred to as denitrogenation because the administration of 100% oxygen causes the nitrogen in the lungs to be completely replaced by oxygen.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">If induction of anesthesia merely causes airway obstruction, chin lift and jaw thrust maneuvers may open the airway and allow spontaneous ventilation to resume. If respiration is significantly depressed or the patient is apneic, the anesthetist must begin providing artificial respirations. Initially, the facemask and breathing bag attached to the anesthesia machine are used. An oral or nasal airway may be inserted to help relieve upper airway obstruction and improve ventilation. A <strong><em>supraglottic airway</em></strong> or an endotracheal tube provides a hands-free airway and allows assisted or controlled ventilation. The most commonly used supraglottic airway is the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) (<strong><a href="#ff19-4">Figure 19.4</a></strong>). This device sits in the posterior pharynx and separates the larynx from the rest of the upper airway. It can be used in spontaneously breathing patients, and, in certain circumstances, to provide controlled ventilation.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The laryngeal mask airway was invented in 1982 by a British anesthetist named Archie Brain. The original prototype was modeled after plaster casts of the glottic area of cadavers.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Endotracheal (ET) tubes are inserted through the larynx and into the trachea (<strong><a href="#ff19-5">Figure 19.5</a></strong>). Most ET tubes used in adults have a cuff at their tracheal end to separate the lungs from the pharynx. This cuff allows positive pressure ventilation and can protect the lungs against aspiration of gastric contents.</p>
<p class="indent">For many surgeries, either the LMA or the ET tube can be safely used. Advantages of the LMA include the following:</p>
<ul class="u_bullb"><li><span>It can be inserted without using paralytic agents.</span></li>
<li><span>It can be inserted blindly.</span></li>
<li><span>It is unlikely to damage teeth, gums, or vocal cords.</span></li>
<li><span>It is less likely than an ET tube to cause hoarseness, coughing, sore throat, or laryngospasm.</span></li>
<li><span>It is less stimulating than an ET tube, so less anesthesia is required to put it in or keep it in.</span></li></ul>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Advantages of the LMA are that it can be inserted without using paralytic agents and that it is less stimulating than an ET tube, requiring less anesthesia before insertion.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The main advantage of the ET tube is that it allows higher inflation pressures during controlled ventilation.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen300">E. The Anesthesia Record</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Medical students and others with no formal training often performed early anesthetics. Complications were routine and mortality was all too common. In 1895, one such medical student was Harvey Cushing (later a well-known neurosurgeon). <a id="page413"></a><a id="page414"></a>Cushing hoped that by keeping a record of the drugs he used and the patient&#x2019;s pulse and respirations, he would learn from his mistakes and administer anesthetics more safely. From Cushing&#x2019;s idea came the modern anesthesia record. Today&#x2019;s anesthesia record contains far more information but still serves much the same purpose as in Cushing&#x2019;s time.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen301">F. Maintenance</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong><em>maintenance</em></strong> phase of the anesthetic begins after induction when the airway is secured. The anesthetist may use various intravenous or inhaled agents to keep a patient unconscious throughout surgery. Most often, a balanced combination of intravenous and inhaled drugs provides the elements of general anesthesia (<strong><a href="ch019-sec02.xhtml#tt19-2">Table 19.2</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch019-sec05.xhtml#bib9">9</a></sup> Sometimes, only inhaled agents are used (<strong><a href="#tt19-6">Table 19.6</a></strong>). In other situations, the anesthetist might only use a total intravenous anesthetic.</p>
<p class="video"><video data-id="rBaK7qrF" controls="controls" class="jwp-video" crossorigin="anonymous" style="width:100%; height:auto; width:320px; height:240px;">Browser issues</video></p>
<p class="video1" id="vid19-5"><strong>VIDEO 19.5</strong></p>
<p class="video2"><strong>Postincision Pain</strong></p>
<p class="indent">The goal of anesthesia is to ensure unconsciousness and amnesia, immobility,&#x00A0;muscle relaxation, and blunted sympathetic reflexes. Both propofol, if given as a continuous infusion, and the potent inhaled agents provide&#x00A0;amnesia and block purposeful movement in response to surgical stimulation.</p>
<p class="indent">Paralytic agents (muscle relaxants) produce immobility (<strong><a href="#tt19-7">Table 19.7</a></strong>). However, paralytic agents do not produce unconsciousness or amnesia and, if used improperly, can leave the patient awake but paralyzed. Intra-abdominal and intrathoracic surgeries often require skeletal muscle relaxation for optimal operating conditions. Muscle relaxants are useful in this situation but must be titrated carefully. If they are not enough, the surgeon may have difficulty exposing the operative site or the patient may cough or move during a delicate part of the procedure. If they are given too much, the patient may still be paralyzed at the end of the surgery. The anesthesiologist decides how much muscle relaxant to give by following the TOF. A patient with two or three of the four twitches should be adequately relaxed for most operations but not so paralyzed that the neuromuscular blocking drug cannot be reversed at the end of the surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">Opioids are commonly given during general anesthesia (<strong><a href="#tt19-8">Table 19.8</a></strong>). They decrease the dose of potent inhaled agent (or propofol) needed to keep the patient unconscious and immobile. They also help minimize the cardiac depression associated with these drugs. During induction, isoflurane and desflurane often produce tachycardia. Small intravenous doses of opioid can block this effect. Lastly, intraoperative opioids may provide <strong><em>postoperative analgesia</em></strong> but may cause respiratory depression, nausea, and vomiting. Paradoxically, intraoperative opioids can produce hyperalgesia and actually increase postoperative pain, leading to higher requirements for postoperative pain medications.<sup><a href="ch019-sec05.xhtml#bib10">10</a>,<a href="ch019-sec05.xhtml#bib11">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Surgical stimulation can produce hypertension and tachycardia, even when a patient is adequately anesthetized. Because some patients may not tolerate this increased cardiac workload, the anesthetist will often try to minimize these sympathetic responses by deepening the anesthetic. Either giving more potent inhaled agent or injecting intravenous opioids should blunt the sympathetic response to surgical stimulation. In some situations, the anesthesiologist may numb the affected area with a peripheral nerve block or the surgeon may inject local anesthetic directly into the operative site. Lastly, sympathetic<a id="page415"></a> blocking drugs such as labetalol, esmolol, or metoprolol can blunt these hemodynamic responses and may decrease postoperative pain compared with the more commonly used opioids.<sup><a href="ch019-sec05.xhtml#bib12">12</a></sup></p>

This catheter is used both to give medications and to infuse fluids (see <a href="ch023.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>). Most patients need only enough fluids to keep their intravenous catheters patent. However, many surgeries cause significant bleeding. Trauma victims also may suffer considerable blood loss even before arriving in the operating room. These patients need additional intravenous fluid.</p>
<p class="indent">The most commonly used intravenous fluids are called <strong><em>crystalloids</em></strong><em>.</em> These fluids are isotonic solutions formulated to mimic the body&#x2019;s electrolyte<a id="page416"></a> composition. Crystalloids are inexpensive and do not require special storage. Although crystalloids can be life-saving when given to a patient suffering significant bleeding, they are inefficient volume expanders. Crystalloids are isotonic, but they are hypo-osmolar. Only about one-third of infused crystalloid stays within the vascular system. The remainder leaks out of the vasculature and causes interstitial edema throughout the body.</p>

<p class="indent">An alternate class of fluids, <strong><em>colloids</em></strong> contain protein (albumin) or starch to maintain osmotic pressure within the blood vessels. Colloids are better volume expanders than crystalloids, but they are expensive and have undesirable side effects (eg, platelet inhibition and possible renal toxicity). Despite years of study, colloids have never been shown to improve outcome compared with the less-expensive but less-efficient crystalloids.<sup><a href="ch019-sec05.xhtml#bib13">13</a></sup> As long as volume status is maintained, most patients can tolerate a remarkable degree of anemia. However, some will require blood and blood products (see <a href="ch024.xhtml">Chapter 24</a>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen303">H. Temperature</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Anesthesia impairs the body&#x2019;s ability to maintain temperature. After induction, core temperature drops as widespread vasodilation causes core body heat to transfer to peripheral tissues. Furthering this heat transfer, anesthetics lower the temperature at which peripheral blood vessels constrict in response to cold. In addition, the operating room environment offers several<a id="page417"></a> avenues for heat loss: <strong><em>radiation, conduction, convection, and evaporation</em></strong>. Patients lose most heat through radiation from their exposed skin to the surrounding cold environment. Conductive heat loss occurs through contact between the patient and the cold operating room table, other equipment, and the air layer surrounding the skin. The body loses heat through convection when this warmed air circulates away from the patient and more heat transfers to the new layer of colder air. Evaporation from skin and respiratory mucosa also drains heat from the body. Together, these events cause core body temperature to decrease about 1&#x00B0; shortly after induction of anesthesia. Body temperature will continue to fall for the next 3 to 5 hours until a new equilibrium is established.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many ways to help maintain the patient&#x2019;s temperature. Prewarming can help prevent the initial redistribution of heat from core to periphery. Warming the operating room is another option. This step is often taken for especially vulnerable patients like small children and trauma victims. However, an operating room that is warm enough for patient comfort is often too warm for the surgical team. One of the most effective ways to maintain a patient&#x2019;s body temperature is with a forced-air warming blanket. These devices blow warmed air across the patient&#x2019;s skin, helping to prevent conductive and convective heat loss. These devices do not prevent the initial redistribution of body heat and can burn the patient&#x2019;s skin if misused. Radiant heat lamps can be helpful, especially when caring for infants and small children.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen304">I. Emergence</h5>
<p class="nonindent">As surgery winds down, anesthesiologists prepare the patient for emergence. They review the patient&#x2019;s hemodynamics and temperature, evaluate the degree of residual neuromuscular blockade, and ensure adequate analgesia for the transition to recovery. At the end of the anesthetic, the patient must be hemodynamically stable and normothermic. Hypothermia can increase oxygen consumption, impair hemostasis, and delay emergence. The unstable patient is better left intubated, ventilated, and sedated until his or her vital signs are normal.</p>
<p class="indent">If the patient has received a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant (<strong><a href="#tt19-6">Table 19.6</a></strong>), the anesthetist will use an anticholinesterase or sugammadex to reverse residual neuromuscular blockade (see <a href="ch011.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>). TOF monitoring can help determine the amount of reversal agent needed.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to assessing the patient&#x2019;s readiness for emergence, the anesthetist begins to decrease or discontinue any intravenous or inhaled anesthetics. The timing of these changes depends on the type of drugs given and the duration of their administration. For example, remifentanil is rapidly broken down by plasma esterases. Its action terminates promptly and predictably no matter how long the anesthetic. On the other hand, isoflurane and sevoflurane are fat soluble and accumulate in the patient&#x2019;s adipose tissues (isoflurane more so than sevoflurane). With these drugs, the longer the anesthetic, the longer the emergence. The anesthetist uses his or her knowledge of the drug kinetics to time the end of the anesthetic.</p>
<p class="indent">Removing the endotracheal tube (extubation) is the trickiest part of the emergence process. Before the patient can be extubated, he or she must have reestablished adequate ventilation and respiration. In addition, the patient<a id="page418"></a> must have appropriate protective airway reflexes. Some patients can be extubated &#x201C;deep&#x201D; before protective airway reflexes have fully recovered, as long as they are ventilating adequately and the anesthetist is prepared to help maintain an open airway. Others should remain intubated until they are awake and can follow commands. Risks of extubating too soon include airway obstruction, aspiration, and <strong><em>laryngospasm</em></strong>. Delaying extubation too long can cause hypertension and tachycardia, increased intracranial pressure, and bleeding, especially in patients who have undergone surgery about the head and neck. Vigorous coughing with an endotracheal tube in place can disrupt abdominal surgical sutures. Once the patient is extubated and ventilating adequately, it is time to go to the recovery room or postanesthesia care unit (PACU).</p>
