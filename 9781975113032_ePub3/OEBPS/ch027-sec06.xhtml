<p class="nonindent">Complete clearance of intra-abdominal CO<sub>2</sub> may require longer than 1 hour, and during that time, patients may experience severe shoulder pain referred from diaphragmatic irritation. However, most patients tolerate laparoscopy quite well except those with limited pulmonary reserve or patients with prior diaphragmatic paralysis. These patients may require postoperative respiratory support until the intra-abdominal CO<sub>2</sub> is resorbed fully and pain control is optimized. Postoperative hemorrhage is rare but should be suspected when there is hemodynamic instability, a distended abdomen, or an unexpectedly low hematocrit.</p>
