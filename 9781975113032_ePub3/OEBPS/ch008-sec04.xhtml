<p class="nonindent">Inhalation anesthetics produce dose-dependent myocardial depression and a decrease in systemic arterial blood pressure. The decrease in blood pressure is mainly due to a reduction of systemic vascular resistance. Heart rate is relatively unchanged by the inhaled anesthetics, although desflurane and to some extent isoflurane can cause sympathetic stimulation, leading to tachycardia and hypertension during induction or when the inspired concentration is abruptly increased (<strong><a href="#ff8-4">Figure 8.4</a></strong>). Nitrous oxide also causes some<a id="page158"></a> increased sympathetic activity. Its direct cardiac depressive effects are neutralized by this increased sympathetic activity in healthy individuals. Unlike the outdated anesthetic halothane, the newer inhaled anesthetics (isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane) do not sensitize the myocardium to circulating catecholamines or predispose patients to dysrhythmias. Inhaled anesthetics are capable of providing myocardial protection against some ischemic and reperfusion injuries that last beyond the elimination of the anesthetic gases. Recent evidence suggests that some inhaled anesthetics, including xenon, also may offer protection against ischemic injury in the kidneys, liver, and brain.</p>
