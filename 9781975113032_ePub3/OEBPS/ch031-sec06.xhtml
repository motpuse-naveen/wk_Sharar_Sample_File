<h5 class="h5" id="sen522">A. Pregnancy-Induced Hypertensive Disorders</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders include gestational hypertension, preeclampsia or eclampsia, and hemolysis-elevated liver enzymes with low platelets (HELLP) syndrome. Pregnancy normally causes a slight decrease in blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure in pregnancy is pathologic and associated with fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. Gestational hypertension is defined as elevated blood pressure occurring after 20&#x00A0;weeks&#x2019; gestation, without accompanying proteinuria. Preeclampsia is defined by elevated blood pressures after 20&#x00A0;weeks&#x2019; gestation, accompanied by proteinuria or other organ-system effects. Eclampsia is preeclampsia with seizure.<sup><a href="ch031-sec09.xhtml#bib14">14</a></sup> The HELLP syndrome is a variant of severe preeclampsia associated with liver dysfunction and thrombocytopenia.</p>
<p class="indent">Preeclampsia can be further categorized as having severe features if any of the following conditions are met: blood pressure elevated over 160&#x00A0;mm Hg systolic or 110&#x00A0;mm Hg diastolic, or end-organ dysfunction, which can manifest as severe headache, vision or cerebral disturbance, pulmonary edema or cyanosis, oliguria or renal failure, liver dysfunction, thrombocytopenia (less than 100,000/&#x00B5;L), or severe epigastric pain. Severe proteinuria and fetal growth restriction are no longer used as indicators of severe features but do frequently occur with the disorder.<sup><a href="ch031-sec09.xhtml#bib14">14</a></sup></p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page665"></a>The etiology of preeclampsia is still being studied, but abnormalities in placental implantation and placental production of thromboxane and prostacyclin may play a role. Poor placental perfusion causes systemic endothelial dysfunction and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, resulting in arteriolar hypertension and edema. Platelet aggregation occurs at sites of endothelial injury, resulting in coagulopathy.</p>
<p class="indent">Severe hypertension can cause focal cerebral ischemia, cerebral edema, or hemorrhage, leading to eclampsia or seizures and death or major disability. A recent ACOG Executive Summary recommends immediate control of blood pressure with intravenous antihypertensives to prevent morbidity and mortality.<sup><a href="ch031-sec09.xhtml#bib14">14</a></sup> Intravenous labetalol and hydralazine are most commonly used, and direct arterial pressure monitoring may be necessary. Magnesium infusion prevents eclampsia.<sup><a href="ch031-sec09.xhtml#bib15">15</a></sup> Magnesium increases the seizure threshold, but has many unwanted side effects. Sedation, decreased reflexes, muscle weakness and potentiation of neuromuscular blockade, and respiratory and cardiovascular depression or arrest are associated with magnesium overdose, which occurs more frequently in patients with renal dysfunction. The practitioner must examine the patient&#x2019;s neurologic status and monitor magnesium levels to prevent overdose. Intravenous calcium is the primary treatment for arrest related to magnesium overdose.</p>
<p class="indent">Ultimately, treatment of preeclampsia requires delivery and removal of the placenta. Early preeclampsia without severe features can be managed expectantly with careful maternal and fetal monitoring and antihypertensives to prevent preterm birth. Preeclampsia with severe features usually represents an indication for delivery once the patient is stabilized and steroids have been administered to hasten fetal lung maturity. Neuraxial anesthesia is contraindicated if coagulopathy is present. If general anesthesia is necessary for cesarean delivery, laryngoscopy and intubation may be difficult due to systemic and airway edema, and short-acting intravenous antihypertensives should be used to prevent severe hypertension during airway management.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen523">B. Diabetes Mellitus</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pregnancy is a diabetogenic state, and women can develop gestational diabetes mellitus. Preexisting diabetes often requires insulin therapy. Blood glucose control is very important during pregnancy to avoid fetal central nervous system and cardiovascular malformations and fetal morbidity and mortality. Babies born to diabetic women with poor glucose control have higher rates of macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, respiratory distress, cardiomyopathy, polycythemia and persistent pulmonary hypertension, and term neonatal intensive care unit admission. During labor, tight glucose control, often with an insulin infusion titrated to maintain blood glucose values between 80 and 110&#x00A0;mg/dL, is utilized to help prevent neonatal hypoglycemia.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen524">C. Obesity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The majority of Americans are overweight, obese, or morbidly obese. Many of the physiologic implications of obesity mirror those of pregnancy and the two may combine to produce exaggerated untoward effects. In particular, obese patients have increased cardiac output, increased work of breathing, <a id="page666"></a>increased oxygen consumption, decreased lung volumes, and more redundant tissue, making them prone to complications during induction and airway management. Obese parturients exhibit exaggerated aortocaval compression when in the supine position. Obesity worsens obstetric and neonatal outcomes, increasing the rates of dysfunctional labor and cesarean delivery, hypertensive diseases of pregnancy, diabetes, fetal macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, and intrauterine fetal demise. Postoperatively these patients demonstrate increased rates of infection, wound disruption, and thromboembolic disease.</p>
<p class="indent">Neuraxial anesthetic techniques are fraught with difficulty, and ultrasound guidance may facilitate block placement. Airway management during administration of general anesthesia should cause concern for failure to ventilate, failure to intubate, and aspiration of gastric contents. The clinician should have a low threshold for awake fiberoptic intubation. Obese parturients should be evaluated soon after admission to the labor and delivery unit, and early neuraxial analgesia is encouraged to decrease the risk of general anesthesia requirement should an emergency cesarean delivery become necessary.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen525">D. Fever and Infection</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pregnancy is an immunosuppressed state, and systemic infection is poorly tolerated. Chorioamnionitis is a common severe infection in pregnant patients that can lead to preterm labor, atony, hemorrhage, and sepsis. Urinary tract infections are also frequent and can lead to ascending infection and pyelonephritis due to poor ureteral valve function in pregnancy. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis are treated in the same manner as for nonpregnant patients, but mortality rates are higher in pregnant patients.</p>
<p class="indent">Genital <strong><em>herpes simplex virus</em></strong> (HSV) is a common sexually transmitted disease and is an indication for cesarean delivery if active genital or cervical lesions are present because of the risk of neonatal HSV infection. Primary herpes infection is associated with flu-like symptoms and genital lesions. Neuraxial anesthesia is controversial during primary infection because of the potential risk of seeding the central nervous system with HSV. Many anesthesia practitioners will not administer neuraxial anesthesia until the lesions associated with primary HSV have begun healing and no signs or symptoms of systemic infection are present. Secondary infections are not considered a contraindication to neuraxial techniques. <strong><em>Oral HSV</em></strong> more commonly recurs in patients who receive neuraxial morphine. The etiology of the recrudescence is unclear and may be related to immunomodulation or to facial pruritus and scratching.</p>
<p class="indent">Pregnant patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy, with the goal viral load being &#x003C;1000 copies/mL. Vaginal delivery is allowed if viral load is &#x003C;1000 copies/mL. If viral load is &#x003E;1000 copies/mL, cesarean delivery helps prevent vertical transmission to the infant. During labor and delivery, the administration of intravenous zidovudine decreases the rate of vertical HIV transmission. Breastfeeding is contraindicated. Neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia are not contraindicated.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen526">E. Epidural Fever</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Temperature rises about 0.4&#x00B0; per hour in women with epidural labor analgesia versus those without, even when controlling for other factors such as pain medication and infection.<sup><a href="ch031-sec09.xhtml#bib16">16</a></sup> The etiology of this temperature rise is unclear, and the clinical significance of the actual temperature difference is also unclear. Women with epidural-related fever during labor may be incorrectly diagnosed with chorioamnionitis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen527">F. <a id="page667"></a>Bleeding Disorders</h5>
<p class="nonindent">von Willebrand disease represents the most common inherited coagulopathy in pregnant women. von Willebrand factor (vWF) is important for normal hemostasis, as it causes adhesion of platelets to injured tissue and serves as a cofactor to factor VIII. Three subtypes of vWF deficiency exist, with deficiencies in either quantitative amount of or qualitative function of vWF. The most common subtype, vWF deficiency type 1, is a result of a decrease in circulating vWF levels. Pregnancy increases circulating levels of vWF and may decrease symptoms or need for treatment. If required, initial therapy for type 1 is with desmopressin (DDAVP), which increases vWF release, doubling to quadrupling the circulating concentrations. Intravenous or intranasal DDAVP begins working in 30 to 60 minutes and lasts for 6 hours. Type 2 has four subcategories and is a result of qualitative abnormalities in vWF causing abnormal function. Subtype 2b is associated with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis if DDAVP is given. Therefore, therapy must include factor VIII concentrate containing vWF (Humate). Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate also contain vWF. However, factor VIII concentrate is recommended if available because of a lower risk of viral disease transmission. Type 3 is a severe, recessive disorder with very low circulating vWF levels and severe bleeding. A hematology consult may guide the therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">Acquired coagulopathies associated with hemorrhage commonly occur and are due to dilution or DIC. Dilutional coagulopathy occurs after massive hemorrhage, when resuscitation consists primarily of packed red blood cells (PRBC) without plasma or platelets. Additionally, DIC is associated with placental abruption and amniotic fluid embolism. Therapy for acquired coagulopathy is supportive and includes transfusion of plasma, cryoprecipitate, and platelets.</p>
