<p class="nonindent">These standards apply to all anesthesia care although, in emergency circumstances, appropriate life support measures take precedence. These standards may be exceeded at any time based on the judgment of the responsible anesthesiologist. They are intended to encourage quality patient care, but observing them cannot guarantee any specific patient outcome. They are subject to revision from time to time, as warranted by the evolution of technology and practice. They apply to all general anesthetics, regional anesthetics, and monitored anesthesia care. This set of standards addresses only the issue of basic anesthetic monitoring, which is one component of anesthesia care. In certain rare or unusual circumstances, (1) some of these methods of monitoring may be clinically impractical, and (2) appropriate use of the described monitoring methods may fail to detect untoward clinical developments. Brief interruptions of continual<a href="#ft2" id="fn2"><sup>*</sup></a> monitoring may be unavoidable. These standards are not intended for application to the care of the obstetrical patient in labor or in the conduct of pain management.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen774">Standard I</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Qualified anesthesia personnel shall be present in the room throughout the conduct of all general anesthetics, regional anesthetics, and monitored anesthesia care.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Objective</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Because of the rapid changes in patient status during anesthesia, qualified anesthesia personnel shall be continuously present to monitor the patient and provide anesthesia care. In the event there is a direct known hazard, eg, radiation, to the anesthesia personnel which might require intermittent remote observation of the patient, some provision for monitoring the patient must be made. In the event that an emergency requires the temporary absence of the person primarily responsible for the anesthetic, the best judgment of the anesthesiologist will be exercised in comparing the emergency with the anesthetized patient&#x2019;s condition and in the selection of the person left responsible for the anesthetic during the temporary absence.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen775">Standard II</h5>
<p class="nonindent">During all anesthetics, the patient&#x2019;s oxygenation, ventilation, circulation, and temperature shall be continually evaluated.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Oxygenation</strong></h6>
<p class="H4MBELOWMHD"><strong>Objective</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">To ensure adequate oxygen concentration in the inspired gas and the blood during all anesthetics.</p>
<p class="H4R"><strong><em>Methods</em></strong></p>
<ol class="u_num3">
<li><span>Inspired gas: During every administration of general anesthesia using an anesthesia machine, the concentration of oxygen in the patient breathing<a id="page979"></a> system shall be measured by an oxygen analyzer with a low oxygen concentration limit alarm in use.<a href="#ft3" id="fn3"><sup>&#x2020;</sup></a></span></li>
<li><span>Blood oxygenation: During all anesthetics, a quantitative method of assessing oxygenation such as pulse oximetry shall be employed.<a href="#ft3"><sup>&#x2020;</sup></a></span></li>
<li><span>When the pulse oximeter is utilized, the variable pitch pulse tone and the low threshold alarm shall be audible to the anesthesiologist or the anesthesia care team personnel.<a href="#ft3"><sup>&#x2020;</sup></a> Adequate illumination and exposure of the patient are necessary to assess color.<a href="#ft3"><sup>&#x2020;</sup></a></span></li></ol>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Ventilation</strong></h6>
<p class="H4MBELOWMHD"><strong>Objective</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">To ensure adequate ventilation of the patient during all anesthetics.</p>
<p class="H4R"><strong><em>Methods</em></strong></p>
<ol class="u_num3">
<li><span>Every patient receiving general anesthesia shall have the adequacy of ventilation continually evaluated. Qualitative clinical signs such as chest excursion, observation of the reservoir breathing bag, and auscultation of breath sounds are useful. Continual monitoring for the presence of expired carbon dioxide shall be performed unless invalidated by the nature of the patient, procedure, or equipment. Quantitative monitoring of the volume of expired gas is strongly encouraged.<a href="#ft3"><sup>&#x2020;</sup></a></span></li>
<li><span>When an endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask is inserted, its correct positioning must be verified by clinical assessment and by identification of carbon dioxide in the expired gas. Continual end-tidal carbon dioxide analysis, in use from the time of endotracheal tube/laryngeal mask placement, until extubation/removal or initiating transfer to a postoperative care location, shall be performed using a quantitative method such as capnography, capnometry, or mass spectroscopy.<a href="#ft3"><sup>&#x2020;</sup></a> When capnography or capnometry is utilized, the end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> alarm shall be audible to the anesthesiologist or the anesthesia care team personnel.<a href="#ft3"><sup>&#x2020;</sup></a></span></li>
<li><span>When ventilation is controlled by a mechanical ventilator, there shall be in continuous use a device that is capable of detecting disconnection of components of the breathing system. The device must give an audible signal when its alarm threshold is exceeded.</span></li>
<li><span>During regional anesthesia (with no sedation) or local anesthesia (with no sedation), the adequacy of ventilation shall be evaluated by continual observation of qualitative clinical signs. During moderate or deep sedation, the adequacy of ventilation shall be evaluated by continual observation of qualitative clinical signs and monitoring for the presence of exhaled carbon dioxide unless precluded or invalidated by the nature of the patient, procedure, or equipment.</span></li></ol>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Circulation</strong></h6>
<p class="H4MBELOWMHD"><strong>Objective</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">To ensure the adequacy of the patient&#x2019;s circulatory function during all anesthetics.</p>
<p class="H4R"><strong><em>Methods</em></strong></p>

<li><span><a id="page980"></a>Every patient receiving anesthesia shall have the electrocardiogram continuously displayed from the beginning of anesthesia until preparing to leave the anesthetizing location.<a href="#ft3"><sup>&#x2020;</sup></a></span></li>
<li><span>Every patient receiving anesthesia shall have arterial blood pressure and heart rate determined and evaluated at least every five minutes.<a href="#ft5" id="fn5"><sup>&#x2020;</sup></a></span></li>
<li><span>Every patient receiving general anesthesia shall have, in addition to the above, circulatory function continually evaluated by at least one of the following: palpation of a pulse, auscultation of heart sounds, monitoring of a tracing of intra-arterial pressure, ultrasound peripheral pulse monitoring, or pulse plethysmography or oximetry.</span></li></ol>
<h6 class="h6">Body Temperature</h6>
<p class="H4MBELOWMHD"><strong>Objective</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">To aid in the maintenance of appropriate body temperature during all anesthetics.</p>
<p class="H4R"><strong><em>Methods</em></strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Every patient receiving anesthesia shall have temperature monitored when clinically significant changes in body temperature are intended, anticipated, or suspected.</p>

<p class="nonindent"><strong>Minimal Sedation (Anxiolysis)</strong> is a drug-induced state during which patients respond normally to verbal commands. Although cognitive function and physical coordination may be impaired, airway reflexes and ventilatory and cardiovascular functions are unaffected.</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>Moderate Sedation/Analgesia (Conscious Sedation)</strong> is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients respond purposefully<a href="#ft6" id="fn6"><sup>&#x2020;</sup></a> to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile stimulation. No interventions are required to maintain a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation is adequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>Deep Sedation/Analgesia</strong> is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients cannot be easily aroused but respond purposefully<a href="#ft6"><sup>&#x2020;</sup></a> following repeated or painful stimulation. The ability to independently maintain ventilatory function may be impaired. Patients may require assistance in maintaining a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>General Anesthesia</strong> is a drug-induced loss of consciousness during which patients are not arousable, even by painful stimulation. The ability to independently maintain ventilatory function is often impaired. Patients often require assistance in maintaining a patent airway, and positive pressure ventilation may be required because of depressed spontaneous ventilation or drug-induced depression of neuromuscular function. Cardiovascular function may be impaired.</p>
<p class="indent">Because sedation is a continuum, it is not always possible to predict how an individual patient will respond. Hence, practitioners intending to produce a given level of sedation should be able to rescue<a href="#ft7" id="fn7"><sup>&#x2021;</sup></a> patients whose level of sedation becomes deeper than initially intended. Individuals administering moderate sedation/analgesia (Conscious Sedation) should be able to rescue<a href="#ft7"><sup>&#x2021;</sup></a> patients who enter a state of deep sedation/analgesia, while those administering deep sedation/analgesia should be able to rescue<a href="#ft7"><sup>&#x2021;</sup></a> patients who enter a state of general anesthesia.</p>

<h4 class="h40" id="sec300">Position on Monitored Anesthesia Care</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen784">Committee of Origin: Economics</h5>
<p class="QUO"><em>(Approved by the House of Delegates on October 25, 2005, and last amended on October 17, 2018)</em></p>
<p class="nonindent">Monitored anesthesia care is a specific anesthesia service performed by a qualified anesthesia provider, for a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. Indications for monitored anesthesia care include, but are not limited to, the nature of the procedure, the patient&#x2019;s clinical condition and/or the need for deeper levels of analgesia and sedation than can be provided by moderate sedation (including potential conversion to a general or regional anesthetic. Unlike monitored anesthesia care, moderate sedation is a proceduralist directed service which does not include a qualified anesthesia provider&#x2019;s periprocedural assessment and has the inherent limitations that are policy directed for the non-anesthesia qualified provider. Moderate sedation is a proceduralist directed service that may be governed by separate institutional policies.</p>
<p class="indent">Monitored anesthesia care includes all aspects of anesthesia care &#x2013; a preprocedure assessment and optimization, intraprocedure care and postprocedure management that is inherently provided by a qualified anesthesia provider as part of the bundled specific service. During monitored anesthesia care, the anesthesiologist provides or medically directs a number of specific services, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul class="u_bullb"><li><span>Preprocedural assessment and management of patient comorbidity and periprocedural risk</span></li>
<li><span>Diagnosis and treatment of clinical problems that occur during the procedure</span></li>
<li><span>Support of vital functions inclusive of hemodynamic stability, airway management and appropriate management of the procedure induced pathologic changes as they affect the patient&#x2019;s coexisting morbidities</span></li>
<li><span>Administration of sedatives, analgesics, hypnotics, anesthetic agents or other medications as necessary for patient safety</span></li>
<li><span>Psychological support and physical comfort</span></li>
<li><span>Provision of other medical services as needed to complete the procedure safely.</span></li></ul>
<p class="nonindent">Monitored anesthesia care may include varying levels of sedation, awareness, analgesia and anxiolysis as necessary. The qualified anesthesiologist provider of monitored anesthesia care must be prepared to convert to general anesthesia and respond to the pathophysiology (airway and hemodynamic changes) of procedure and position in the management in induction of general anesthesia when necessary. If the patient loses consciousness and the ability to respond purposefully, the anesthesia care is a general anesthetic, irrespective of whether airway instrumentation is required. Moderate Sedation/Analgesia on the other hand is a drug induced depression of consciousness in which the patient responds purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile stimulation. It is not anticipated that intervention will be required to maintain a patent airway and adequate spontaneous ventilation. Similarly, it is expected that cardiovascular function will be maintained without intervention.</p>
<p class="indent">Monitored anesthesia care is a physician service provided to an individual patient. Whereas &#x201C;Moderate Sedation/Analgesia&#x201D; is a service directed by the Proceduralist who is preoccupied in focusing on successfully completing the scheduled procedure. The Proceduralist may not be cognizant of ongoing pathophysiologic effects of sedatives given or procedure/position changes. Monitored anesthesia care should be subject to the same level of payment as general or regional anesthesia. Accordingly, the ASA Relative Value Guide<sup>&#x00AE;</sup> provides for the use of proper base units, time and any appropriate modifier units as the basis for determining payment.</p>
<a id="page988"></a>
<h4 class="h40" id="sec301">Distinguishing Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC) From Moderate Sedation/Analgesia (Conscious Sedation)</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen785">Committee of Origin: Economics</h5>
<p class="QUO"><em>(Approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 27, 2004, last amended on October 21, 2009, and reaffirmed on October 17, 2018)</em></p>
<p class="nonindent">Moderate Sedation/Analgesia (Conscious Sedation; hereinafter known as Moderate Sedation) is a physician service recognized in the CPT procedural coding system. During Moderate Sedation, a physician supervises or personally administers sedative and/or analgesic medications that can allay patient anxiety and limit pain during a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. During Moderate Sedation the responsible physician typically assumes the dual role of performing the procedure and supervising the sedation. Such drug-induced depression of a patient&#x2019;s level of consciousness to a &#x201C;moderate&#x201D; level of sedation, as defined in the Joint Commission (TJC) standards, is intended to facilitate the successful performance of the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure while providing patient comfort and cooperation. Physicians providing moderate sedation must be qualified to recognize &#x201C;deep&#x201D; sedation, manage its consequences and adjust the level of sedation to a &#x201C;moderate&#x201D; or lesser level. The continual appraisal of the effects of sedative or analgesic medications on the level of consciousness and on cardiac and respiratory function is an integral element of this service.</p>
<p class="indent">The American Society of Anesthesiologists has defined Monitored Anesthesia Care (see <em>Position on Monitored Anesthesia Care, updated on October 17, 2018</em>). This physician service can be distinguished from Moderate Sedation in several ways. An essential component of MAC is the periprocedural anesthesia assessment and understanding of the patient&#x2019;s coexisting medical conditions and management of the patient&#x2019;s actual or anticipated physiological derangements during a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. While Monitored Anesthesia Care may include the administration of sedatives and/or analgesics often used for Moderate Sedation, the qualified anesthesia provider of MAC is focused exclusively and continuously on the patient for any attendant airway, hemodynamic and physiologic derangements. Further, the provider of MAC must be prepared and qualified to convert to general anesthesia. The proceduralist providing moderate sedation may have their attention diverted to their primary focus, the procedure. Additionally, a provider&#x2019;s ability to intervene to rescue a patient&#x2019;s airway from any sedation-induced compromise is a prerequisite to the qualifications to provide Monitored Anesthesia Care. By contrast, Moderate Sedation is not expected to induce depths of sedation that would impair the patient&#x2019;s respiratory function or ability to maintain the integrity of his or her airway. These components of Monitored Anesthesia Care are unique aspects of an anesthesia service that are not part of Moderate Sedation.</p>
<p class="indent">The administration of sedatives, hypnotics, analgesics, as well as anesthetic drugs commonly used for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia is often, but not always, a part of Monitored Anesthesia Care. In some patients who may require only minimal sedation, MAC is often indicated because even small doses of these medications could precipitate adverse physiologic responses that would necessitate acute clinical interventions and resuscitation. The attention of the proceduralist is focused on the completion of the procedure, not physiologic alterations. If a patient&#x2019;s condition and/or a<a id="page989"></a> procedural requirement is likely to require sedation to a &#x201C;deep&#x201D; level or even to a transient period of general anesthesia, only a practitioner privileged to provide anesthesia services should be allowed to manage the sedation. Due to the strong likelihood that &#x201C;deep&#x201D; sedation may, with or without intention, transition to general anesthesia, the skills of an anesthesia provider are necessary to manage the effects of general anesthesia on the patient as well as to return the patient quickly to a state of &#x201C;deep&#x201D; or lesser sedation.</p>
<p class="indent">Like all anesthesia services, Monitored Anesthesia Care includes an array of post-procedure responsibilities beyond the expectations of practitioners providing Moderate Sedation, including assuring a return to baseline consciousness, relief of pain, management of adverse physiological responses or side effects from medications administered during the procedure, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of co-existing medical problems.</p>
<p class="indent">Monitored Anesthesia Care allows for the safe administration of a maximal depth of sedation in excess of that provided during Moderate Sedation. The ability to adjust the sedation level from full consciousness to general anesthesia during the course of a procedure provides maximal flexibility in matching sedation level to patient needs and procedural requirements. In situations where the procedure is more invasive or when the patient is especially fragile, optimizing sedation level is necessary to achieve ideal procedural conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">In summary, Monitored Anesthesia Care is a physician service that is clearly distinct from Moderate Sedation due to the expectations and qualifications of the provider who must be able to utilize all anesthesia resources to support life and to provide patient comfort and safety during a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure.</p>

<h4 class="h40" id="sec302">Ethical Guidelines for the Anesthesia Care of Patients With Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders or Other Directives that&#x00A0;Limit Treatment</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen786">Committee of Origin: Ethics</h5>
<p class="QUO"><em>(Approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 17, 2001, and last amended on October 17, 2018)</em></p>
<p class="nonindent"><em>These guidelines apply both to patients with decision-making capacity and also to patients without decision-making capacity who have previously expressed their preferences.</em></p>
<ol class="uroman">
<li><span>Given the diversity of published opinions and cultures within our society, an essential element of preoperative preparation and perioperative care for patients with do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders or other directives that limit treatment is communication among involved parties. It is necessary to document relevant aspects of this communication.</span></li>
<li><span>Policies automatically suspending DNR orders or other directives that limit treatment prior to procedures involving anesthetic care may not sufficiently address a patient&#x2019;s rights to self-determination in a responsible and ethical manner. Such policies, if they exist, should be reviewed and revised, as necessary, to reflect the content of these guidelines.</span></li>
<li><span>The administration of anesthesia necessarily involves some practices and procedures that might be viewed as &#x201C;resuscitation&#x201D; in other settings. Prior to procedures requiring anesthetic care, any existing directives to limit the use of resuscitation procedures (ie, do-not-resuscitate orders and/or advance directives) should, when possible, be reviewed with the patient or designated surrogate. As a result of this review, the status of these directives should be clarified or modified based on the preferences of the patient. One of the three following alternatives may provide for a satisfactory outcome in many cases.</span>
<ol class="u_lalpha3">
<li><span>Full Attempt at Resuscitation: The patient or designated surrogate may request the full suspension of existing directives during the anesthetic and immediate postoperative period, thereby consenting to the use of any resuscitation procedures that may be appropriate to treat clinical events that occur during this time.</span></li>
<li><span>Limited Attempt at Resuscitation Defined With Regard to Specific Procedures: The patient or designated surrogate may elect to continue to refuse certain specific resuscitation procedures (eg, chest compressions, defibrillation, or tracheal intubation). The anesthesiologist should inform the patient or designated surrogate about which procedures are (1) essential to the success of the anesthesia and the proposed procedure, and (2) which procedures are not essential and may be refused.</span></li>
<li><span>Limited Attempt at Resuscitation Defined With Regard to the Patient&#x2019;s Goals and Values: The patient or designated surrogate may allow the anesthesiologist and surgical/procedural team to use clinical judgment in determining which resuscitation procedures are appropriate in the context of the situation and the patient&#x2019;s stated goals and values. For example, some patients may want full resuscitation procedures to be used to manage adverse clinical events that are believed to be quickly and easily reversible but to refrain from treatment for conditions that are likely to result in permanent sequelae, such as neurologic impairment or unwanted dependence upon life-sustaining technology.</span></li></ol></li>
<li><span><a id="page991"></a>Any clarifications or modifications made to the patient&#x2019;s directive should be documented in the medical record. In cases where the patient or designated surrogate requests that the anesthesiologist use clinical judgment in determining which resuscitation procedures are appropriate, the anesthesiologist should document the discussion with particular attention to the stated goals and values of the patient.</span></li>
<li><span>Plans for postoperative/postprocedural care should indicate if or when the original, preexistent directive to limit the use of resuscitation procedures will be reinstated. This occurs when the patient leaves the postanesthesia care unit or when the patient has recovered from the acute effects of anesthesia and surgery/procedure. Consideration should be given to whether continuing to provide the patient with a time-limited or event-limited postoperative/postprocedure trial of therapy would help the patient or surrogate better evaluate whether continued therapy would be consistent with the patient&#x2019;s goals.</span></li>
<li><span>It is important to discuss and document whether there are to be any exceptions to the injunction(s) against intervention should there occur a specific recognized complication of the surgery/procedure or anesthesia.</span></li>
<li><span>Concurrence on these issues by the primary physician (if not the surgeon/proceduralist of record), the surgeon/proceduralist and the anesthesiologist is desirable. If possible, these physicians should meet together with the patient (or the patient&#x2019;s legal representative) when these issues are discussed. This duty of the patient&#x2019;s physicians is deemed to be of such importance that it should not be delegated. Other members of the healthcare team who are (or will be) directly involved with the patient&#x2019;s care during the planned procedure should, if feasible, be included in this process.</span></li>
<li><span>Should conflicts arise, the following resolution processes are recommended:</span>
<ol class="u_lalpha3">
<li><span>When an anesthesiologist finds the patient&#x2019;s or surgeon&#x2019;s/proceduralist&#x2019;s limitations of intervention decisions to be irreconcilable with one&#x2019;s own moral views, then the anesthesiologist should withdraw in a nonjudgmental fashion, providing an alternative for care in a timely fashion.</span></li>
<li><span>When an anesthesiologist finds the patient&#x2019;s or surgeon&#x2019;s/proceduralist&#x2019;s limitation of intervention decisions to be in conflict with generally accepted standards of care, ethical practice, or institutional policies, then the anesthesiologist should voice such concerns and present the situation to the appropriate institutional body.</span></li>
<li><span>If these alternatives are not feasible within the time frame necessary to prevent further morbidity or suffering, then in accordance with the American Medical Association&#x2019;s Principles of Medical Ethics, care should proceed with reasonable adherence to the patient&#x2019;s directives, being mindful of the patient&#x2019;s goals and values.</span></li>
</ol></li>
<li><span>A representative from the hospital&#x2019;s anesthesiology service should establish a liaison with surgical, procedural, and nursing services for presentation, discussion, and procedural application of these guidelines. Hospital staff should be made aware of the proceedings of these discussions and the motivations for them.</span></li>
<li><span>Modification of these guidelines may be appropriate when they conflict with local standards or policies and in those emergency situations involving patients lacking decision-making capacity whose intentions have not been previously expressed.</span></li>
