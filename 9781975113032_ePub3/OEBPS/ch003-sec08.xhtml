<h4 class="h4" id="sec28">VIII. Blood Pressure</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen55">A. Systemic, Pulmonary, and Venous</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Cardiac output enters the systemic and pulmonary circulations from the LV and RV, respectively, each of which contain serial arterial, microcirculatory,<a id="page59"></a> and venous components. Systemic blood pressures exceed pulmonary blood pressures due to differing anatomic structures and pump capabilities of the RV and LV, significantly lower vascular impedance of the pulmonary circulation compared with the systemic circulation, and nearly identical cardiac outputs in both circulations, the fluid mechanics analogue of <strong><em>Ohm law</em></strong> (pressure&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;flow&#x00A0;&#x00D7;&#x00A0;resistance).</p>
<p class="indent">The typical aortic <strong><em>pressure waveform</em></strong> is shown in <strong><a href="#ff3-15">Figure 3.15</a></strong>. The peak of the wave is the <strong><em>systolic blood pressure</em></strong> (SBP), and the nadir is the <strong><em>diastolic blood pressure</em></strong> (DBP), with the difference between the two termed the <strong><em>pulse pressure</em></strong> (PP). As the pressure wave moves distally in the arterial tree, the sharp dicrotic notch becomes more scooped, the SBP increases, the DBP decreases, and the PP increases due to the combination of elastic properties of the large artery walls, partial wave reflection at large artery branch points, and decreasing vessel compliance in smaller arteries. The <strong><em>mean arterial pressure</em></strong> (MAP) is the average pressure over the entire period and can be estimated from sphygmomanometer measurements of the SBP and DBP (MAP&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;DBP&#x00A0;+&#x00A0;[0.33&#x00A0;&#x00D7;&#x00A0;PP]). Perfusion pressure refers to the driving pressure required to perfuse a specific tissue or organ and is defined as the difference between the MAP and the resistance pressure that must be overcome to affect perfusion. For example, the cerebral perfusion pressure is the MAP minus the intracranial pressure. Because the large arteries have elastic components and properties, the arterial system is distensible and able to maintain positive pressure throughout the cardiac cycle. Thus, only a portion of the energy of cardiac contraction results in forward capillary flow, with the remainder stored as potential energy in the elastic recoil of the arteries, a property known as the <strong><em>Windkessel effec</em></strong><em>t</em>. Thus, this elastic property attenuates pulse pressure during systole, and as a result, its elastic recoil during diastole allows for forward flow and end organ perfusion throughout the entire cardiac cycle.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of lower vascular impedance in the pulmonary circulation, the RV accomplishes pulmonary perfusion with lower systolic pressures and less oxygen consumption and generates significantly lower arterial outflow pressures compared with the LV. Under normal anatomic conditions, the cardiac output of the RV is slightly lower than that of the LV due to bronchial blood flow from the systemic circulation (&#x223C;1% of the total cardiac output) that returns deoxygenated blood directly to the left atrium. A very small portion of the cardiac output is returned directly to the LV from coronary arterial luminal shunts and coronary veins (Thebesian veins).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen56">B. Vascular Resistance</h5>
<p class="nonindent">For the systemic circulation, the blood pressure, cross-sectional area, and volume capacitance vary widely across its arterial, microcirculatory, and venous components. The arterioles serve as the principal points of resistance to blood flow in the systemic circulation, producing roughly 95% reduction in mean intravascular pressure. In the absence of mechanical obstruction in more proximal arteries, the modulation of arteriolar vascular smooth muscle tone is therefore the principal determinant of SVR and serves three important functions: (1) regulation of differential tissue blood flow to specific vascular beds; (2) modulation of systemic arterial blood pressure; and (3) converting pulsatile to nonpulsatile blood flow to facilitate consistent capillary perfusion.</p>

<p class="indent">Resting vascular smooth muscle exerts mild tonic arteriolar vasoconstriction that can be modulated by autonomic SNS activity, circulating hormones, drugs, ambient temperature, local metabolic activity, and autoregulation to achieve further vasoconstriction or vasodilation. For example, autonomic SNS stimulation results in norepinephrine release that activates &#x03B2;-adrenergic receptors in vascular smooth muscle to augment resting vasoconstriction. In vascular beds containing both &#x03B1;- and &#x03B2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors (eg, skeletal muscle), exogenous epinephrine at low doses will selectively activate &#x03B2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors and cause vasodilation, whereas high doses will result in predominate activation of &#x03B1;-adrenergic receptors and lead to enhanced vasoconstriction. Local metabolic activity plays an important role in regional control of vascular resistance because arterioles lie within the organ itself and are exposed to the local environment. When blood flow to tissue is inadequate to meet metabolic needs, local factors (eg, high carbon dioxide [CO<sub>2</sub>], low pH) result in vasodilation in an attempt to increase blood flow to meet metabolic demand.</p>

Each pulse is easily separated into systole and diastole by the dicrotic notch, with the peak pressure corresponding the systolic pressure and the lowest pressure being the diastolic pressure. Mean arterial pressure is the average pressure over the entire pulse period (B). The pulse pressure waveform changes as one moves distally in the systemic arterial tree due to arterial branching and changes in vessel elasticity.</figcaption></figure></div>

<p class="dify">In the elderly, age-related autonomic nervous system dysfunction interferes with the baroreceptor reflex arc, such that hypotension-induced compensatory increases in heart rate and blood pressure are less pronounced compared to young adults.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong><em>Autoregulation</em></strong> refers to the intrinsic tendency of a specific organ or tissue bed to maintain constant blood flow despite changes in arterial pressure, independent of hormonal or neural mechanisms. Autoregulation is typically active within a specific range of arterial pressures, within which constant flow is achieved by changes in vascular resistance (<strong><a href="#ff3-16">Figure 3.16</a></strong>). Outside this range, blood flow varies proportionately to arterial pressure, with clinical consequences of ischemia (low pressure) or hyperemia (high pressure). The human organs with the most clinically significant autoregulation features are the brain, kidneys, and heart.<sup><a href="ch003-sec10.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen57">C. Baroreceptor Function</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to the immediate regulation of blood flow by autoregulation at the tissue level, more widespread and short-term adjustments in systemic arterial pressure are also regulated by the baroreceptor reflex (<strong><a href="ch003-sec03.xhtml#tt3-1">Table 3.1</a></strong>; <strong><a href="#ff3-17">Figure 3.17</a></strong>). This<a id="page62"></a> inverse relation between arterial blood pressure and heart rate was first described by Etienne Marey in 1859 and serves to preserve cardiac output and arterial pressure under varying conditions such as postural changes, exercise, and hypovolemia. The afferent limb of the reflex is initiated by pressure-sensitive stretch receptors in the carotid sinus and the aortic arch that relay sensory information to the medullary vasomotor center via the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The efferent limb of the reflex includes two possible responses: (1) elevated arterial pressure results in increased vagal PNS tone and decreased SNS tone, which modifies heart rate downward at the SA and AV nodes and reduces both myocardial contractility and arteriolar vasoconstriction to diminish both cardiac output and arterial pressure; (2) low arterial pressure results in increased SNS traffic at various levels of the sympathetic chain to modify heart rate upward at the SA node and augment ventricular contractility to enhance cardiac output, as well as increase arteriolar vasoconstriction to rapidly increase arterial pressure.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff3-16"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff3-16.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="caption"><span class="fignum">Figure&#160;3.16</span> Autoregulation occurs when blood flow (<em>lower panel</em>) is maintained relatively constant over a wide range of mean arterial pressures (in this case 60-140&#x00A0;mm Hg). This process is accomplished by changes in vascular resistance (<em>upper panel</em>) that are independent of neural and hormonal influence.</figcaption></figure></div>

Elevated blood pressure results in efferent vagal nerve traffic to the heart that slows heart rate and reduces contractility (to reduce blood pressure). In contrast, low blood pressure results in efferent sympathetic tone via the spinal cord and sympathetic chain that increases both heart rate and contractility, and also results in peripheral vasoconstriction.

<p class="indent">One clinical application of the baroreceptor reflex is the performance of external carotid massage in patients with supraventricular tachycardia. This will stimulate afferent glossopharyngeal nerve traffic and enhance reflex PNS vagal tone to slow pathologic tachycardias. The baroreceptor reflex also underlies the typical observation of compensatory tachycardia in patients with hypovolemic hypotension. Conversely, abnormal baroreceptor reflex responses can occur<a id="page63"></a> in patients with neurologic impairments at any point along the reflex arc. For example, age-related autonomic dysfunction in the elderly is often manifest by postural syncope due to reductions in cerebral perfusion pressure and flow.</p>
