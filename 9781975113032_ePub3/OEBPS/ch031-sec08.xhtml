<h4 class="h4" id="sec201">VIII. Complications of Neuraxial Anesthesia</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen530">A. Postdural Puncture Headache or Epidural Blood Patch</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) occurs after puncture of the dura, with resultant leakage of CSF. The associated headache is theorized to occur because CSF loss is greater than production, resulting in low CSF volume and pressure. Reflexive cerebral vasodilation then occurs, causing headache. The headache is classically frontal or occipital, may be associated with neck stiffness or pain, increases in severity with sitting position, and is relieved by supine position. It may be accompanied by cranial nerve palsies (abducens palsy is most common), nausea and vomiting, or tinnitus. The majority of PDPHs resolve within 1&#x00A0;week, but some may persist longer. Development of PDPH after dural puncture is higher in young, thin, women with histories of headaches and when larger gauge, cutting needles are used. The risk of headache development in pregnant women after dural puncture with an epidural needle (17-18 gauge) is over 50%.<sup><a href="ch031-sec09.xhtml#bib24">24</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Treatment of PDPH is either conservative (intravenous fluid and oral caffeine and analgesics) or with epidural blood patch (EBP). During an EBP, the anesthesiologist draws the patient&#x2019;s blood sterilely and injects it into the epidural space, &#x201C;patching&#x201D; the dural hole with clot and stopping the CSF leakage. Usually, 15 to 20&#x00A0;mL of blood is administered. Sometimes development of back or neck pain <a id="page671"></a>with injection limits the volume of blood that can be used. EBP typically relieves pain immediately, but may need to be repeated if headache recurs as the clot is resorbed. When PDPH does not respond to EBP or is associated with fever or other neurologic abnormalities, further diagnostic testing is indicated to rule out meningitis or intracranial hemorrhage or thrombosis.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen531">B. Local Anesthetic Overdose</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Epidural catheters can unintentionally become intravascular during either initial placement or from migration later. If a large dose of intravenous local anesthetic is accidentally given intravenously, systemic toxicity can occur. Neurotoxicity typically manifests before cardiotoxicity and includes changes in mental status, seizures, and obtundation. Cardiovascular effects first become evident as widening of the QRS complex and progress to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation and arrest. At the first signs of overdose, local anesthetic should be discontinued, and oxygen and lipid emulsion administered. Lipid emulsion binds free local anesthetic to prevent further blockage of cardiac sodium channels. However, channels that are already affected will not be altered. Therefore, circulatory support, CPR, and even cardiopulmonary bypass may be necessary to rescue, particularly in the case of bupivacaine overdose (<strong><a href="#ff31-10">Figure 31.10</a></strong>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen532">C. Nerve Damage</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nerve injuries may arise independently of obstetric or anesthetic interventions. They occur at a rate of 0.8% and are thought to be due to fetal head compression of nerves during passage through the pelvis or nerve stretch or compression from patient positioning during labor and delivery. Mean duration of injury is 2 to 3&#x00A0;months. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is most often affected and presents with numbness over the lateral thigh, often termed meralgia paresthetica. The femoral nerve is the second most common site of injury, and palsies of this nerve can be sensory, motor, or mixed and occasionally occur bilaterally. Nulliparity, fetal macrosomia, prolonged second stage of labor, instrumented delivery, and prolonged duration of hip hyperflexion are associated with increased rates of injury. Regional labor analgesia was not associated with nerve injury in a large prospective study.<sup><a href="ch031-sec09.xhtml#bib25">25</a></sup> Occasionally, root injuries or radiculopathy may present postpartum due to exacerbation of underlying pathologies such as disk herniation. During neuraxial block, a needle or catheter may directly traumatize nerves, resulting in injury. Such an injury is usually preceded by paresthesias during block placement. Persistence of paresthesias or severe pain during a neuraxial technique should prompt withdrawal of the needle or catheter.</p>
<p class="indent">Documentation of neurologic examination and preexisting deficits prior to neuraxial procedures is important, and intrinsic nerve injuries due to labor and delivery must be distinguished from those resulting from neuraxial anesthesia. Electromyogram may be helpful in determining the amount of time a deficit has been present.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen533">D. Neuraxial Hematoma or Abscess</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Epidural bleeding or abscess can be catastrophic because of pressure exerted on the spinal cord or cauda equina. Neuraxial hematoma is a rare event, but traumatic or difficult placement and coagulopathy or anticoagulant use increase the likelihood of occurrence. The American Society of Regional Anesthesia recommendations for use of anticoagulants and placement of neuraxial anesthesia can be viewed at their website. Motor weakness that persists or worsens despite discontinuation of local anesthetic is the most common presentation for a neuraxial hematoma. Back pain sometimes accompanies the weakness. Time is important in cases of neuraxial hematoma because neurologic outcomes are worse the longer treatment is delayed. MRI represents the best imaging modality for diagnosis. Neuraxial hematoma necessitates immediate neurosurgical consultation for possible emergent decompression of the clot.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong><em>Neuraxial infection</em></strong> may manifest as either meningitis or abscess; both are very uncommon events. Contaminants causing meningitis tend to arise from the nasopharynx of the provider who placed the block. Abscess may be due to the patient&#x2019;s skin flora. Sterile preparation, draping, and use of a surgical mask are standard during placement of neuraxial blocks to prevent iatrogenic infection.</p>
