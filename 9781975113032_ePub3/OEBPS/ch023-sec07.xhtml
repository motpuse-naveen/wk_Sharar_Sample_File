<h5 class="h5" id="sen369">A. Physiologic Role of Electrolytes</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The body&#x2019;s primary electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and chloride) are critical components of physiologic homeostasis. In the ionized form in which they exist in both ICF and ECF, these electrolytes create electrical and osmotic gradients that are tightly regulated and essential to many of the body&#x2019;s core functions. Abnormalities of serum electrolyte levels in the perioperative and critical care setting can lead to severe perturbations in physiologic function. Clinical manifestations of these various abnormalities are shown in <strong><a href="#tt23-12">Table 23.12</a></strong>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen370">B. Sodium</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Sodium is the most prevalent electrolyte in the ECF. Abnormalities of serum sodium are most often due to some form of abnormal renal water regulation. Loss of water by the kidneys or in the gastrointestinal tract, lack of oral intake<a id="page497"></a> (typically in the setting of an impaired thirst mechanism), or administration of hypertonic salt solutions may all lead to <strong><em>hypernatremia</em></strong>. Clinical manifestations of hypernatremia are varied. Correction of hypernatremia can be achieved with 0.9% saline, 0.45% saline, or 5% dextrose in water, depending on the cause and level of sodium elevation. Great care should be taken to avoid rapid overcorrection of the serum sodium in cases of chronic hypernatremia. Except in emergent circumstances, hypernatremia should not be corrected more quickly than &#x223C;0.7 mEq/h, to avoid fluid shifts that can lead to life-threatening cerebral edema.</p>

<p class="dify">Too rapid correction of both hypernatremia or hyponatremia&#x2014;particularly when chronic&#x2014;can result in central nervous system dysfunction, including cerebral edema and central pontine myelinolysis.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The differential diagnosis of <strong><em>hyponatremia</em></strong> is presented in <strong><a href="#ff23-5">Figure 23.5</a></strong>. Clinical manifestations can be mild to severe, and at its extreme, cerebral edema, coma, or seizures may develop. As a general rule, patients cannot become more hyponatremic than they already are if hypotonic fluid is not administered. Thus, fluid restriction to an amount less than the previous day&#x2019;s urine output is a reasonable initial measure. In cases of symptomatic hyponatremia (severely altered mentation or seizures), correction with hypertonic saline is recommended. Overzealous correction, however, as with the<a id="page498"></a> irreversible and devastating neurologic injury of central pontine myelinolysis, can result from too rapid correction of the serum sodium.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Hyperkalemia</strong></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen371">C. Potassium</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Abnormalities in potassium concentration hold great clinical significance, as <strong><em>hyperkalemia</em></strong> may result in severe life-threatening cardiac conduction abnormalities (<strong><a href="#ff23-6">Figure 23.6</a></strong>). Its differential diagnosis includes renal insufficiency or failure, metabolic acidosis, severe tissue injury or rhabdomyolysis, iatrogenic oversupplementation, or drug effect (succinylcholine, nonselective beta-blockers). Symptomatic hyperkalemia is often not present until serum<a id="page499"></a> levels are &#x003E;6.5 mEq/L, and its treatment should initially include administration of parenteral calcium as a cardiac membrane stabilizer. Reduction in the serum potassium level can be achieved by administration of a combination of dextrose and insulin (the latter forces uptake of potassium into cells), sodium bicarbonate if the patient is acidemic (potassium is forced into cells in exchange for H<strong><sup>+</sup></strong> ion to achieve pH balance), or treatment with furosemide or &#x03B2;-agonists. Ultimately, none of these mechanisms lowers total body potassium definitively, as this requires either potassium-binding resins (eg, Kayexalate) or hemodialysis.</p>
<div class="figureu5" id="ff23-6"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff23-6.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="ucaption"><span class="u_fignum">Figure&#160;23.6</span> As hyperkalemia progresses from mild to severe, the electrocardiogram tracing evolves in a predictable fashion and may include abnormal T waves, ST segments, QRS duration, and characteristic dysrhythmias.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hypokalemia</em></strong> may be seen in the setting of excessive diuresis or in patients with renal artery stenosis or hyperaldosteronism. Clinically, the condition may also lead to cardiac dysrhythmias, and early electrocardiogram (ECG) findings include blunted T waves and the presence of U waves. Treatment includes potassium supplementation and correction of the underlying condition. Serum potassium does not accurately reflect changes in total body potassium stores, which are equal to &#x223C;50 mEq/kg. Depending on the patient&#x2019;s size, it will take 150 to 300 mEq of exogenous potassium to raise the serum potassium 1 mEq/L. However, potassium supplementation is commonly given orally or intravenously in 10, 20, 40, or 80 mEq aliquots. Intravenous potassium is toxic and extremely painful and must be diluted prior to administering. Hypokalemia is rarely life-threatening, and thus standard practice for intravenous potassium replacement is not to exceed 10 mEq/h using a peripheral intravenous line. Using a central venous catheter, however, it may be given at a rate up to 40 mEq/h when necessary.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen372">D. Calcium</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Calcium is a divalent cation that exists in both albumin-bound and physiologically active ionized forms in the serum. Within the cells, free calcium ion exists at a very low concentration and is mostly sequestered within specific<a id="page500"></a> organelles. The release of calcium into the intracellular environment is critical for a number of cell-signaling pathways and second messenger systems. Calcium homeostasis is maintained by a complex system that involves absorption from the gastrointestinal tract (a vitamin D&#x2013;regulated process), reabsorption from bone stores (parathyroid hormone function), and renal excretion or reabsorption (parathyroid hormone function).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hypercalcemia</em></strong> is seen in a number of clinical settings, including hyperparathyroidism, bony metastases, thiazide diuretic use, and hypervitaminosis D. A shortened QT interval is a common ECG finding. Treatment for symptomatic hypercalcemia includes aggressive saline administration, loop diuretics, and potentially hemodialysis.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hypocalcemia</em></strong> may be secondary to hypoparathyroidism, renal failure, vitamin D deficiency, tumor lysis syndrome, and alkalosis. An important perioperative cause is massive blood transfusion, as the citrate anticoagulant in transfused blood products will bind calcium and deplete levels in the serum. Treatment includes calcium supplementation and treatment of the underlying cause. When assessing serum calcium levels, bear in mind that total calcium levels are affected by serum albumin, such that low serum albumin will result in low total calcium levels. To correct for this, simply measure the ionized calcium levels.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen373">E. Magnesium</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Magnesium is the second most important physiologically active divalent cation next to calcium. Magnesium is a critical component of nucleic acid structure and is an important cofactor for numerous enzymatic functions. It also plays a role in the maintenance of normal serum levels of other electrolytes. <strong><em>Hypermagnesemia</em></strong> may be seen in cases of hemolysis, tumor lysis, renal insufficiency, or in severe burns or trauma. In minor cases, symptoms are similar to those of hypercalcemia. However, if serum levels continue to rise, this may result in progressive atrioventricular block and cardiac arrest. Treatment includes parenteral calcium supplementation as a membrane stabilizer and hemodialysis to definitively decrease serum magnesium levels.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hypomagnesemia</em></strong> may occur due to renal losses, chronic diarrhea, alcoholism, diuresis, nutritional deficiency, or in cases of refeeding syndrome. Symptoms are similar to those for hypocalcemia. ECG findings may include a wide QRS or long QT segment. Treatment of the underlying condition is key. It is also important to note that repletion of magnesium is essential in order to adequately maintain normal serum potassium and calcium levels.</p>
