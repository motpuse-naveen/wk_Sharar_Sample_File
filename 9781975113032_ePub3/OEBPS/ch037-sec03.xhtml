<p class="nonindent">In addition to known common comorbid conditions such as CAD, systemic hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity, and tobacco abuse, the vascular patient may have other undiagnosed conditions including hypercoagulable states, renal insufficiency, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep apnea, and others. If surgery is elective, preoperative management should focus on optimizing all the patient&#x2019;s chronic conditions, a process that cannot be accomplished if the patient presents on the morning of surgery.</p>
