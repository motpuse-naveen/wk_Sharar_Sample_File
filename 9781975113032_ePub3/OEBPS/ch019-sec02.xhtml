<h5 class="h5" id="sen291">A. Patient Assessment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Surgery stresses the body, and anesthetics have significant physiologic effects. Therefore, before giving any anesthetic, the anesthesiologist evaluates the patient, looking for problems that might increase risk. This assessment requires knowledge of the patient&#x2019;s past and current medical and surgical conditions. The preoperative evaluation may be completed in person by the anesthesiologist, by a nurse in a preoperative clinic or via a phone interview, or by the patient via a web-based questionnaire. In many centers, healthy patients presenting for outpatient surgery and any patient needing emergency surgery may be evaluated on the day of the operation.</p>
<p class="indent">The preanesthetic evaluation begins with the chief complaint: In this case, what surgery is needed and why. Although this information should be available in the medical record, confirming the site and side of surgery directly with the patient is an important safeguard against wrong-site, wrong-side surgery. Next the patient&#x2019;s age, height, and weight are reviewed. Extremes in any of these values can present unique concerns (see <a href="ch028.xhtml">Chapters 28</a> and <a href="ch033.xhtml">33</a>). Reviewing the patient&#x2019;s surgical history can alert the anesthesiologist to significant medical problems. Questions about previous anesthetics can help prepare for a <a id="page404"></a>difficult airway, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and other possible complications. Even if a patient has never had anesthesia, the family history might reveal malignant hyperthermia, pseudo-cholinesterase deficiency, or other heritable problems. The anesthesiologist also checks the patient&#x2019;s medications and allergies and asks targeted questions about the patient&#x2019;s medical problems and systems review.</p>

<p class="indent">On the day of surgery, the anesthesiologist reviews the patient&#x2019;s history and conducts a focused physical examination with emphasis on the heart, lungs,<a id="page405"></a> airway and, if regional anesthesia is planned, the site of the regional anesthetic. Most patients need only this focused history and physical examination before undergoing anesthesia. Some, because of coexisting diseases, and others, because of the proposed surgery, will need additional evaluation.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen292">B. Anesthetic Plan</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Anesthesia is often viewed as &#x201C;putting the patients to sleep.&#x201D; However, there are multiple ways to provide an anesthetic. Choosing the best approach requires an understanding of each patient, his or her medical history, and the proposed procedure. Ideally, an anesthetic should produce the minimum physiologic trespass, optimal surgical conditions, and a comfortable and expeditious recovery.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The duration of required fasting (NPO) before an anesthetic depends on the type of food or liquid ingested. For clear liquids, it is as short as 2 hours, but for fatty foods, it is at least 8 hours.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen293">C. Nil Per Os Status</h5>
<p class="nonindent">General anesthesia and sedation place patients at risk for regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents. This complication can produce problems ranging from mild <strong><em>chemical pneumonitis</em></strong> and pneumonia to death (see <a href="ch040.xhtml">Chapter 40</a>). To minimize this risk, a patient should fast before an elective anesthetic.<a id="page406"></a> The duration of fasting (nil per os [NPO]) depends on the type of food or liquid ingested (<strong><a href="#tt19-4">Table 19.4</a></strong>). Despite these NPO guidelines, patients may take oral medications with a sip of water on the day of surgery (see <a href="ch016.xhtml">Chapter 16</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">There are exceptions to these rules. Emergency surgeries must begin regardless of the duration of fasting. Trauma patients, those in severe pain, and those with nausea and vomiting or intestinal obstruction may have full stomachs regardless of how long they have been NPO. For these patients, the anesthesiologist may choose a <strong><em>rapid sequence</em></strong> induction to quickly secure the airway and minimize the risk of aspiration. Also, due to the physiologic changes of pregnancy, parturients are treated as having a full stomach regardless of their last food or liquid intake (see <a href="ch031.xhtml">Chapter 31</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen294">D. Informed Consent</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The last step in the preoperative evaluation is obtaining informed consent, which should be targeted to the patient&#x2019;s specific risks and concerns. Disclose pertinent risks and allow the patient to ask questions. In some cases (ie, minors), a legal guardian or medical proxy will give consent. Regardless, it is important for the patient to understand and agree with the anesthetic plan. Rarely, in a life-threatening emergency, anesthesia and surgery may proceed without informed consent.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen295">E. Premedication</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Many patients are anxious when they are getting ready to have surgery. A thorough preoperative consultation with an anesthesiologist is the best way to relieve a patient&#x2019;s anxiety.<sup><a href="ch019-sec05.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup> In addition, patients sometimes receive a small dose of intravenous benzodiazepine (ie, midazolam) for additional anxiolysis before entering the operating room. Midazolam should be used carefully. Oversedated patients may not cooperate with moving and positioning in the operating room. In outpatient settings, even small doses of midazolam can delay discharge. The elderly are especially sensitive to its sedating effects.</p>
