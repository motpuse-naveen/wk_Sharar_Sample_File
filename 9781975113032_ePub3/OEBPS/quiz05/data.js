Morphine and meperidine undergo metabolic conversion to potentially neurotoxic compounds that rely on renal clearance; for this reason, they are best avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Morphine-6-glucuronide, a morphine metabolite more potent that its parent compound, may also accumulate in patients with CKD and result in profound respiratory depression. Hydromorphone also has an active metabolite, hydromorphone-3-glucuronide, that may accumulate in patients with CKD.</p>"
