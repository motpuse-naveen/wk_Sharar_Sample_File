<h4 class="h4" id="sec36">IV. Chronic Kidney Disease</h4>
<p class="nonindent">CKD is defined by the International Society of Nephrology and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for more than 3&#x00A0;months (<strong><a href="#tt5-10">Table 5.10</a></strong>). CKD is classified based on cause, GFR, and albuminuria.<sup><a href="ch005-sec05.xhtml#bib13">13</a></sup> Grades of CKD have been established according to GFR and albuminuria, and risk can be apportioned according to these grades (<strong><a href="#ff5-10">Figure 5.10</a></strong>). Hypertension and diabetes are the leading causes of CKD, accounting for &#x003E;70% of cases. The National Kidney Foundation&#x2019;s (NKF) Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for all stages of CKD and their related complications, including the management of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and anemia.<sup><a href="ch005-sec05.xhtml#bib13">13</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The kidneys exhibit various compensatory mechanisms to the loss of nephron volume that accompanies CKD. While effective in the short term, these mechanisms can contribute to long-term exacerbation of kidney injury. For example, there is accelerated filtration in the normally functioning nephrons&#x2014;a process known as hyperfiltration. This occurs as a result of glomerular hypertension through activation of the RAAS and increased glomerular permeability. Over the long term, this leads to glomerulosclerosis and chronic tubulointerstitial ischemia.</p>
<p class="indent">Changes in bone structure and mineralization are nearly universal in patients with CKD, a complication known as renal osteodystrophy. The precipitating factor is decreased vitamin D activation in the kidney, which in turn leads to impaired gastrointestinal calcium absorption. Hypocalcemia stimulates parathyroid hormone secretion in an effort to restore serum calcium concentrations at the expense of increased bone resorption. Furthermore, as GFR decreases, phosphate clearance also decreases. An increase in serum phosphate concentration results in a reciprocal decrease in serum calcium concentration. Not only does this exacerbate hyperparathyroidism but also leads to calcium phosphate crystal deposition in joints that can lead to joint pain and increased fracture risk. Anemia occurs as a result of decreased erythropoietin&#x2014;a hormone normally secreted by the kidneys&#x2014;and decreased red cell survival time. The anemia is usually normochromic and normocytic. The current NKF guidelines for the treatment of anemia is to maintain a hemoglobin &#x003E;13&#x00A0;mg/dL; this is accomplished by the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin or the synthetic analogue darbepoetin. Both platelet and white blood cell functions are impaired in patients with kidney disease. The most common laboratory abnormality is increased bleeding time.</p>

<p class="indent">Cardiovascular diseases occur more frequently in patients with CKD and are the most common causes of death in this population; however, sepsis and infectious-related deaths are also more common. Systemic hypertension contributes to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, and cardiac ischemia. The etiology is multifactorial&#x2014;volume and sodium overload, anemia, and hypertension are among the relevant factors. Uremic pericarditis is a unique complication of severe renal disease and may precipitate life-threatening cardiac tamponade.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with <strong><em>end-stage renal disease</em></strong> require dialysis for survival. These patients have added physiologic derangements because of the dialysis therapy itself and the means of delivering that dialysis (<strong><a href="#tt5-11">Tables 5.11</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#tt5-12">5.12</a></strong>). Complications associated with chronic dialysis include an increased risk of infection, protein calorie deficiency malnutrition, amyloidosis, and uremia.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen82">A. Drug Prescribing in Renal Failure</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Many factors contribute to the altered drug pharmacokinetics seen in patients with CKD. In addition to reduced clearance, increased volume of distribution, decreased plasma protein binding, acidemia, coexisting liver disease, and changes in gastrointestinal uptake are all factors. Knowledge of a drug&#x2019;s pharmacokinetics will assist in modifying dose and interval timing and may help predict and prevent unwanted side effects<sup><a href="ch005-sec05.xhtml#bib14">14</a>,<a href="ch005-sec05.xhtml#bib15">15</a></sup> (<a href="ch007.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>) When possible, choosing drugs that do not rely on the kidneys for excretion is optimal. Drugs with active or toxic metabolites (eg, meperidine, morphine) are best avoided, as these metabolites can accumulate in patients with renal disease. For the most part, drug doses rarely require modification until the GFR is less than 30&#x00A0;mL/min. For medications with a wide therapeutic index, the interval between doses is often increased. For those who a narrow therapeutic index, reduced doses at normal intervals typically provide more predictable steady-state concentrations. Avoidance of known nephrotoxins, including contrast dye, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, aminoglycosides, and vancomycin, is<a id="page107"></a> also important. Though not renal toxins, per se, ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blockers may compromise renal blood flow; therefore, they should be used cautiously in patients with compromised renal function.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen83">B. Anesthetic Drugs in CKD</h5>
<p class="nonindent">All volatile anesthetics reduce renal blood flow via their ability to decrease systemic arterial pressure and cardiac output. The pharmacokinetics of volatile anesthetics are not dependent on renal function, protein binding, or volume of distribution. Nephrotoxicity has been attributed to the <strong><em>fluoride ion</em></strong> released during the metabolism of the older anesthetics methoxyflurane and possibly enflurane in patients who have had long exposure to these agents. A similar association has not been observed with sevoflurane, despite the fact that it too produces the fluoride ion when during metabolism. In the presence of some carbon dioxide absorbents (soda lime, Baralyme), sevoflurane undergoes nonenzymatic degradation to an alkene known as compound A, which has been shown to be a dose-dependent nephrotoxin in animals. While no study has demonstrated clinically significant nephrotoxicity in humans, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that sevoflurane be used with fresh gas flow rates of at least 1 to 2&#x00A0;L/min.</p>
<p class="indent">Drugs eliminated unchanged by the kidneys (some nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, cholinesterase inhibitors, many antibiotics) have increased elimination half-times in patients with CKD, inversely related to GFR. Many<a id="page108"></a> anesthetic drugs are protein bound to varying degrees. As a result of the hypoproteinemia that accompanies CKD, the free (active) fraction of many drugs is increased. Of the induction agents, thiopental is most extensively protein bound and therefore most affected in CKD, with ketamine and etomidate being less affected. Propofol is not affected by changes in kidney function because it is rapidly biotransformed by the liver into inactive metabolites, which are then excreted by the kidneys. Benzodiazepines are highly protein bound; therefore, the free fraction of benzodiazepines is increased in patients with CKD. In addition, diazepam and midazolam should be used with caution because active metabolites may accumulate in the presence of kidney dysfunction.</p>

<p class="indent">The use of fentanyl or ultrashort-acting narcotics is preferable in patients with kidney disease. The pharmacokinetics of remifentanil is unaffected by kidney disease, as remifentanil degrades rapidly by ester hydrolysis in the blood. Morphine and meperidine undergo metabolism to potentially neurotoxic compounds (morphine-3-glucuronide and normeperidine, respectively) that rely on renal clearance and are therefore best avoided in patients with CKD. Morphine-6-glucuronide, a morphine metabolite more potent than its parent compound, may also accumulate in patients with CKD and result in profound respiratory depression. Hydromorphone also has an active metabolite, hydromorphone-3-glucuronide, that may accumulate in patients with CKD; however, hydromorphone is better tolerated than morphine. The most important considerations are cautious dosing and careful monitoring for respiratory depression.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Repeated dosing or chronic use of meperidine, morphine, and hydromorphone in renal disease is associated with accumulation of excitatory neurotoxic metabolites.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Short-acting muscle relaxants are preferable in patients with renal disease; atracurium and cisatracurium, which are metabolized by spontaneous, organ-independent, nonenzymatic degradation, are the drugs of choice. Nevertheless, these two drugs have a toxic metabolite, laudanosine, which may accumulate during infusion of the parent drug and has been shown to be epileptogenic in animals. Succinylcholine is generally safe in patients with CKD who are not severely hyperkalemic. The potassium release after succinylcholine administration is not exaggerated in patients with kidney disease; an increase of 0.5 mEq/L is typical. Both vecuronium and rocuronium have been reported to have prolonged action in patients with severe kidney disease. Sugammadex is a muscle relaxant reversal agent that inactivates by encapsulation the steroidal neuromuscular blocking agents (NMDAs) vecuronium and rocuronium. The sugammadex-NMDA complex is excreted unchanged in the urine. Although the complex can be removed by dialysis, use of sugammadex is not advised in patients with estimated GFRs less than 30&#x00A0;mL/min.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen84">C. Management of Anesthesia for Patients With Renal Disease</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There is reasonable evidence to suggest that neuraxial anesthesia in the context of abdominal or cardiac surgery is associated with a reduced risk of AKI. Presumably, this is related to reduced systemic and renovascular sympathetic tone.</p>
<p class="indent">Dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, has been shown to reduce the incidence of cardiac surgery&#x2013;associated AKI, although its impact on long-term outcomes remains controversial.<sup><a href="ch005-sec05.xhtml#bib16">16</a>,<a href="ch005-sec05.xhtml#bib17">17</a></sup> Presumably, this effect is due to intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties. As previously discussed, there is no evidence that dopamine administration preserves kidney function, despite the presence of vasodilatory dopamine receptors in the kidney. While some studies suggest the dopamine agonist fenoldopam may exert renoprotective effects, this finding is yet to be confirmed in large clinical trials.</p>
