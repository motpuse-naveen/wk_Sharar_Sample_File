<p class="nonindent">With regional anesthesia, the pain pathways are blocked at the level of spinal cord and nerve roots, nerve plexus, or peripheral nerve, providing excellent analgesia and facilitating both rapid recovery and functional physical therapy. Multimodal analgesic agents similar to those described previously for spine surgery should also be included in the postoperative care plan to provide comprehensive postoperative analgesia care, particularly for those patients with chronic pain or substance use disorders. Accelerated availability of high-fidelity ultrasound and the relative speed of learning ultrasound-guided approaches to basic peripheral nerve blocks have led to increased popularity of these techniques in the last 10 to 15&#x00A0;years. Coupled with the rapid escalation in opioid use leading to associated public health dangers, the safety of regional analgesic methods offers great promise as a component of care pathways for a variety of surgical procedures, particularly joint replacement. Many acute trauma patients, such as those with extremity fractures, can also benefit from selective early application of regional blocks, achieving superior pain relief with reduced need for opioids and sedatives.</p>
