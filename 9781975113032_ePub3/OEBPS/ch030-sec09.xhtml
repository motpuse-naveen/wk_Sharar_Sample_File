<h5 class="h5" id="sen504">A. Overview of Traumatic Brain Injury</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Traumatic brain injury</em></strong> is often associated with other trauma (eg, thoracic, abdominal, and orthopedic injuries) and is a common cause of death and disability in young people. Death following traumatic brain injury is often associated with secondary insults, which emergency and anesthetic management are designed to minimize. Patients presenting with traumatic brain injury are graded according to the <strong><em>Glasgow coma scale (GCS)</em></strong> on presentation (score of 3-15) and are intubated when GCS is 8 or less, as this corresponds to 35% mortality (<strong><a href="#tt30-2">Table 30.2</a></strong>). Noncontrast CT scan that shows midline shift &#x003E;5&#x00A0;mm or absent ventricles should also lead to immediate intubation, as ICP is very high in these cases and ventilation must be controlled. ICP monitoring is frequently used in these cases and can be instituted in the emergency department by an external ventricular drain, where mannitol, hyperventilation, and propofol are used to control elevated ICP. Operative management is normally indicated for depressed skull fractures and expanding brain bleeding, including subdural and epidural hematomas.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen505">B. Anesthetic Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients presenting with traumatic brain injury are assumed to have concomitant cervical spine injury, and the plan for intubation must take this into account. Hypoxemia is common, which may be further exacerbated by pulmonary injury. Induction doses of anesthetics must be tailored so as to avoid worsening systemic hypotension. Succinylcholine is controversial in the face of a closed head injury, as it may raise ICP transiently. But most anesthesiologists would use it to facilitate securing the airway in a rapid and predictable fashion. Nasal intubation is contraindicated if a basilar skull fracture is present or suspected. Once the airway is secured, attention must be paid to hemodynamics, as systolic blood pressure &#x003C;80&#x00A0;mm Hg is associated with a worse neurologic outcome. Fluid resuscitation and vasopressors are needed to ensure an adequate systemic and cerebral perfusion pressure. Intravascular access should include an arterial catheter and large-bore intravenous cannulae, if not a central venous line. Anesthetic maintenance hinges on a good understanding of ICP management (see above), with intravenous agents and inhalational agents used in balance to avoid excessive cerebral vasodilation. Additional mannitol may be given, but hyperventilation should not continue beyond 2 to 6 hours, as normalization of the pH in the CSF begins to occur and its effect is only to decrease cerebral perfusion. Of note, the release of brain tissue thromboplastin may lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation, and coagulopathy must be aggressively sought and treated. Likewise, neurogenic pulmonary edema may be present, and a &#x201C;lung-protective strategy&#x201D; using PEEP and low tidal volumes may be needed to maintain oxygenation. Extubation at the conclusion of surgery depends on the degree of ICP elevation and the severity of injury, with most of these patients being admitted to the neurointensive care unit intubated and sedated.</p>
