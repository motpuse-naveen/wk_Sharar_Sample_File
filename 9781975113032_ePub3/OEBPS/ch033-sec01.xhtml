<h5 class="h5" id="sen561">A. Cardiovascular System</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>1. Normal Fetal to Pediatric Cardiovascular Transition</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Development of <strong><em>normal cardiovascular physiology</em></strong> in the pediatric patient depends on the transition from fetal circulation to an adult flow pattern.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup> The fetus uses the low vascular resistance placenta as the organ of respiration and therefore does not require pulmonary blood flow. Placental venous blood streams past the liver through the ductus venosus to provide venous inflow to the right atrium and is shunted across the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus into the left heart and aorta bypassing the right heart flow and the pulmonary circuit (<strong><a href="#ff33-1">Figure 33.1</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">During the birthing process, elimination of the low resistance placental circulatory bed results in a rise in the neonate&#x2019;s <strong><em>systemic vascular resistance</em></strong>. This is coupled with the decrease in neonatal pulmonary vascular resistance. This reduces and eventually eliminates the blood flow that had been directed away from the lungs through the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus. The rise in arterial oxygen level when the neonate initiates breathing is essential to maintain blood flow through the alveolar vascular bed.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the pulmonary vascular resistance declines at birth, it is not at the normal adult level until the end of the neonatal period. Any factor that can cause a rise in the <strong><em>pulmonary vascular resistance</em></strong> (eg, hypoxia, hypothermia, respiratory, or metabolic acidosis) can precipitate a reversion to a fetal circulatory pattern, with reopening of the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus shunting blood away from the neonate&#x2019;s lungs. There are other differences in cardiac function that distinguish the pediatric heart from the adult heart. Most notable is the fact that the young child has a relatively noncompliant heart that depends on rate rather than contractility to boost cardiac output.</p>
<h6 class="h6">2. Common Congenital Cardiac Malformations</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Malformations of the cardiac anatomy include many variations in which the ventricular and atrial chambers and the cardiac valves are deformed, causing abnormal blood flow patterns. Viewing congenital heart disease as a physiologic assessment enables the clinician to group the various lesions into three general categories: lesions that cause obstruction to blood flow without shunting, lesions that result in an increase in pulmonary blood flow through a shunt pathway, and lesions that result in a decrease in pulmonary blood flow through a shunt pathway.</p>
<a id="page701"></a>
<div class="figureu5" id="ff33-1"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff33-1.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="ucaption"><span class="u_fignum">Figure&#160;33.1</span> <strong>Fetal circulation showing direction of blood from the placenta (umbilical artery) that allows blood to bypass the fetal lungs via the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Congenital aortic stenosis</em></strong> and <strong><em>coarctation of the aorta</em></strong> represent examples of non&#x2013;shunt-obstructing congenital cardiac defects (<strong><a href="#ff33-2">Figure 33.2A</a> and <a href="#ff33-2">B</a></strong>). The major physiologic impairment is an increase in myocardial workload. Congenital aortic stenosis can be associated with rapid cardiac arrest when the stenotic valve is so narrow that the left ventricle fails to generate sufficient forward cardiac output to supply oxygen to the coronary circulation. A critical difference from adult aortic stenosis is that the pediatric heart does not have sufficient time to adapt and hypertrophy to compensate and overcome the valvular obstruction.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ventricular septal defect (VSD)</em></strong> <a id="page702"></a>is the most common congenital cardiac lesion (<strong><a href="#ff33-2">Figure 33.2C</a></strong>). It results in shunting of blood from the higher pressure left ventricle to the lower pressure right ventricle. As long as the shunt communication is sufficiently large to allow flow through it and the pulmonary vascular resistance is sufficiently low to allow flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary vascular bed, lesions like VSD will increase pulmonary blood flow. The overall shunt is from left to right. However, at any time during the cardiac cycle, the flow may cease or become right to left, highlighting the distinct possibility for paradoxical embolization from the venous to arterial circulation. When an <strong><em>atrial septal defect</em></strong> (<strong><a href="#ff33-2">Figure 33.2D</a></strong>) (another example of a lesion that increases pulmonary blood flow) is present, paradoxical embolization to the cerebral circulation that causes a stroke in adult life may be the first diagnostic clue of the presence of the intracardiac communication.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)</em></strong> (<strong><a href="#ff33-2">Figure 33.2E</a></strong>) is an example of those congenital cardiac abnormalities that result in a decrease in pulmonary blood flow. The obstruction to normal blood flow out of the right ventricle into the pulmonary outflow tract causes shunting from the right to left circulations through the VSD that is part of TOF (right to left shunt [cyanotic]). All congenital cardiac lesions that shunt blood flow away from the lungs have some obstruction to right heart outflow into the pulmonary circuit. Understanding this principle makes it easier to understand the physiology and anatomy of the congenital lesions.</p>
<p class="indent">Anesthetic management of neonates displaying transitional circulation and pediatric patients with congenital cardiac lesions mandates use of medications and techniques that promote control of pulmonary vascular resistance and a balance between the pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances. The goal is to optimize the ratio of pulmonary to systemic circulation as best as anatomically possible.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen562">B. Pulmonary System</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>1. Normal Fetal to Pediatric Transition</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong><em>pulmonary system</em></strong> is involved in dramatic developmental changes in the transition from fetal to postnatal physiology.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup> The lungs undergo active development throughout the gestational period and childhood. Alveolar development primarily occurs in the third trimester beginning in the saccular stage (24-38&#x00A0;weeks) and peaking in the alveolar stage (36&#x00A0;weeks-8&#x00A0;years).<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> Infants born prematurely benefit from maternal antenatal administration of glucocorticoids, which promote maturation of the fetal lung and surfactant production.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Surfactant</em></strong> is one of the most important factors contributing to adequate gas exchange during the transition to postnatal life. Surfactant is produced by type II endothelial cells, which proliferate during the alveolar stage. It is a mixture of neutral lipids, phospholipids, and specific proteins with an amphipathic nature, which leads to a decrease in surface tension that stabilizes alveoli and provides alveolar inflation while reducing hydrostatic forces that cause pulmonary edema.</p>
<p class="indent">During the transition to extrauterine life, the first breaths lead to an increase in pulmonary arterial oxygen (P<span class="usmall">O</span><sub>2</sub>) and a decrease in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P<span class="usmall">CO</span><sub>2</sub>), which stimulates pulmonary vascular dilation, decreases <strong><em>pulmonary vascular resistance</em></strong>, and causes constriction of the ductus arteriosus (<strong><a href="#tt33-1">Table 33.1</a></strong>).</p>
<a id="page703"></a>

B, Coarctation of the aorta also can lead to intracardiac shunting. Depending on the location of coarctation in relation to a patent ductus arteriosus, intracardiac shunting can be either right to left (preductal) or left to right (postductal). C, Ventricular septal defect leads to intracardiac shunting. Direction (right to left or left to right) depends on associated cardiac anatomy. D, Atrial septal defect leads to intracardiac shunting. Direction (right to left or left to right) depends on associated cardiac anatomy. E, Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) consists of four anatomical abnormalities: (1) ventricular septal defect, (2) right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, (3) right ventricular hypertrophy, and (4) overriding aorta. (If an atrioventricular defect is present, the malformation is termed a pentalogy of Fallot.) TOF lesion leads to a right to left intracardiac shunt.

<h6 class="h6">2. Respiratory Function</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Respiratory function differs significantly in infants and children. Oxygen consumption is dramatically higher than adult levels, at approximately 7 to 9&#x00A0;mL/kg/min (<strong><a href="#tt33-2">Table 33.2</a></strong>). The demand for oxygen is met with increased minute ventilation and with an increased ratio of minute ventilation to functional residual capacity (FRC) ratio. However, the FRC is relatively low compared with the minute ventilation. Infants and children can rapidly develop hypoxemia from a combination of higher oxygen consumption and lower oxygen reserve.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Inhalation induction as well as emergence of anesthesia is faster in infants and children as a result of increased minute ventilation relative to adults.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Chest wall compliance</em></strong> in neonates is higher than that in adults because the ribs and intercostal muscles are not fully developed, which can lead to significant retractions that do not provide efficient effort for gas exchange. The primary mechanism driving respiratory effort in neonates is the diaphragm, which is easily fatigued when the work of breathing is increased due to increased resistance to ventilation or hyperventilation.</p>
<p class="h7"><strong><em>Meconium Aspiration</em></strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Fetal hypoxemia may result in intrauterine passage of meconium that mixes with amniotic fluid. The fetal breath movements will then result in pulmonary exposure to meconium prenatally. During birth, infants may also aspirate meconium produced during labor. The latter scenario is consistent with thick meconium that can cause a mechanical airway obstruction. Current Pediatric Advanced Life Support recommendations do not support routine suctioning for infants born with meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Meconium aspiration may result in alveolar damage, which results in impaired oxygenation as well as increased pulmonary vascular resistance.</p>

<p class="h7"><strong><em>Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn</em></strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The pulmonary circulation is highly sensitive to pH and oxygen levels, as well as other mediators such as nitric oxide, adenosine, prostaglandins, and lung inflation.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup> During the newborn period, certain factors can impair vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular tree (<strong><a href="#tt33-3">Table 33.3</a></strong>) and result in elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. Systemic hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias may result, particularly if the right ventricle is not able to compensate and right atrial dilation ensues.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen563">C. Renal System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The kidneys begin to receive increased blood flow after the transition to postnatal circulation. However, the <strong><em>glomerular filtration rate (GFR)</em></strong> remains lower than adult levels for the first 2&#x00A0;years of life. As a result, infants have impaired ability to retain free water. Therefore, infants are less likely to tolerate prolonged fasting periods, particularly during the first few weeks of life. Their inability to regulate GFR to excrete large amounts of water also leads to an inability to tolerate fluid overload without resulting electrolyte abnormalities. Urine output is initially low, but increases to 1 to 2&#x00A0;mL/kg/h after the first day of life.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen564">D. Hepatic System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The synthetic and metabolic functions of the <strong><em>liver</em></strong> remain immature in term newborns. The enzymes required for metabolism and drug elimination are present but have not been induced yet.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> The results are variable, depending <a id="page706"></a>on the medication and elimination pathways. Morphine relies on hepatic biotransformation for elimination; therefore, it has a prolonged half-life in neonates. Alternatively, lidocaine does not demonstrate prolonged elimination. Synthetic function is also limited, as exhibited by decreased albumin and vitamin K production, which is one of the medications routinely administered at birth to prevent postpartum hemorrhagic complications such as intraventricular hemorrhage.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen565">E. Central Nervous System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The infant central nervous system (CNS) experiences rapid growth and development from synaptogenesis, pruning, and neuronal myelination.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup> Although neurodegeneration and apoptosis are part of normal neural development, over the past 20&#x00A0;years, there has been concern on anesthetic-induced neurodegeneration.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib6">6</a>,<a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup> This is seen in infant animal models with all commonly used anesthetics and displays a dose-duration dependency.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib6">6</a>,<a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup> Retrospective studies on the effects of anesthesia on the developing human brain showed equivocal result; some showed a very small decrease in performance on neurodevelopmental tests later in life.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib9">9</a>-<a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib13">13</a></sup> As a result, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration stated that exposure to anesthetic medicines for lengthy or multiple periods may negatively affect neurodevelopment in children aged 3&#x00A0;years or younger, while also recognizing that many surgeries or procedures that require anesthesia should proceed if medically necessary, and that consideration should be given to delaying elective surgery where appropriate.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib14">14</a></sup> Recently three large prospective studies showed no difference in neurodevelopmental outcomes in human infants exposed to short anesthetics (&#x003C;1 hour) early in life.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib15">15</a>-<a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib18">18</a></sup> Most most pediatric surgical procedures are not truly elective, but in light of the recent evidence, it is unlikely that undergoing anesthesia for a short period will affect neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>
