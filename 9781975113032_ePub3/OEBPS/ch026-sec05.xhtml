<h4 class="h4" id="sec156">V. Surgery to the Upper Extremities</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Regional anesthesia is an excellent choice for anesthesia and postoperative analgesia for upper extremity surgery from the shoulder to the fingers. Ultrasound guidance may be particularly advantageous for peripheral upper extremity blocks targeting nerves in close proximity to large vascular structures and the lung (eg, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and interscalene blocks). However, some surgical factors (bilateral procedures or prolonged surgery) and patient factors (severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe pulmonary disease, preexisting neurologic deficits, impaired cognition, or failed regional block) may require general anesthesia. Patients who are considered candidates for regional block may find themselves surprised with the potentially long duration of sensory and motor block following a surgical-density brachial plexus block, and some may find this experience to be unwelcome, despite the excellent analgesia that<a id="page558"></a> usually accompanies the block. Therefore, in addition to discussing block risks, the anesthesiologist should try to offer realistic expectations of the postsurgical course when seeking informed consent.<sup><a href="ch026-sec09.xhtml#bib13">13</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen406">A. Surgery to the Shoulder and Upper Arm</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Common shoulder and upper arm procedures include arthroplasty, arthroscopy, subacromial decompression, rotator cuff repair, repair of fracture, and frozen shoulder manipulation. Lateral decubitus and beach chair positions are commonly used with either pharmacologic neuromuscular paralysis or a motor block that facilitates arm traction. Significant blood loss may occur because tourniquet use is not feasible, so careful hemodynamic monitoring is required and serial hemoglobin measurement may be necessary (<strong><a href="#tt26-9">Table 26.9</a></strong>; <strong><a href="#ff26-4">Figures 26.4</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#ff26-5">26.5</a></strong>). If the patient is in the beach chair position, then blood pressure targets must be chosen to account for the hydrostatic pressure difference between the arm and the brain. The effective mean arterial pressure decreases by 1 mm Hg for every 1.35 cm of elevation of the blood column from the heart to the brain. Severe cerebral hypotension can occur, leading to watershed ischemia and intraoperative stroke.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen407">B. Surgery to the Elbow</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Surgeries involving the elbow can be done with either open (eg, total elbow replacement, fracture repair) or endoscopic (elbow arthroscopy) techniques. Minimally invasive surgery and advances in sedation practices have resulted in an increased ability to perform most elbow surgeries on an ambulatory basis<a id="page559"></a><a id="page560"></a> with an emphasis on fast recovery and excellent analgesia. Such surgeries can be performed under general anesthesia or regional anesthesia (supraclavicular or interscalene block).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen408">C. Surgery to the Wrist and Hand</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A majority of distal arm and hand procedures are performed on an outpatient basis with regional anesthesia. Supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or axillary blocks can all be used, but axillary block is often favored to avoid potential (albeit low) risk of pneumothorax. For hand surgery, specific ulnar, median, or radial nerves can be targeted and blocked, often more distally in the extremity than the classic nerve plexus blocks. Brief surgery below the elbow can also be performed with intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier block) that is simple to perform and has rapid onset and a high success rate. Tourniquet pain with Bier block can be alleviated with use of a double-cuff tourniquet. However, the Bier block provides no postoperative analgesia at the surgical site upon tourniquet release, unlike direct nerve or plexus blocks.</p>
