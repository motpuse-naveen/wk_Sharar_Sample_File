<p class="nonindent">Laparoscopic surgery has four basic steps: gaining access to the peritoneal cavity, establishing the pneumoperitoneum, the surgical procedure, and the closure. Prior to peritoneal access, the stomach and bladder are decompressed in order to minimize the likelihood of bowel or bladder injury. Then, access can be established using two accepted techniques: an open approach (<strong><em>Hasson</em></strong>) or a closed approach (<strong><em>Veress</em></strong> needle). The Hasson technique uses a small incision performed anywhere on the abdomen but is most commonly done periumbilically, followed by placement of the trocar through that incision and insufflation of the abdomen. The Veress needle technique uses blind passage of the needle through the skin into the peritoneal cavity, followed by insufflation. The Veress needle technique is preferred in patients without intra-abdominal adhesions or umbilical hernias and has a higher risk of organ puncture compared with the Hasson approach.</p>

<p class="indent">After accessing the peritoneal cavity, it is slowly insufflated with <strong><em>carbon dioxide</em></strong> <strong>(</strong><strong><em>CO</em></strong><strong><em><sub>2</sub></em></strong><strong>)</strong> until the intra-abdominal pressure reaches 10 to 15&#x00A0;mm Hg and the abdominal wall is sufficiently distended to allow the surgical procedure. The laparoscopic camera is introduced into the abdomen, and under the visual guidance it provides, additional ports are placed with trocars as needed for the other instruments required for surgery. For robot-assisted procedures, access to the peritoneal cavity is obtained with either technique, followed by laparoscopic exploration of the cavity, placement of the robotic instruments in the peritoneum, positioning of the robot, and then attachment of the robotic arms to the instruments (<strong><a href="#ff27-1">Figure 27.1</a></strong>). The surgeon and his first assistant are seated at consoles separate from the operating table, and their hand movements are computer translated into the movement of the robotic arms and instruments (<strong><a href="ch027-sec02.xhtml#ff27-2">Figure 27.2</a></strong>). Following the surgical procedure, the abdominal entry sites are closed.</p>
