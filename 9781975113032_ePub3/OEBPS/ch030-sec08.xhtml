<h4 class="h4" id="sec191">VIII. Common Surgical Procedures</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen497">A. Surgery for Tumors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Neurosurgery is commonly performed to remove tumors, both benign and malignant, that emanate from or spread to the CNS or PNS. Common primary tumors include meningiomas, astrocytomas, glioblastomas, schwannomas, and oligodendrogliomas, whereas metastatic tumors may arise from various primary sites (eg, lung, breast, skin). Independent of their histology, the morbidity of brain tumors is associated with their size, rate of growth, and proximity to or invasion of nearby structures. Patients with dangerously elevated ICP preoperatively may require preoperative CSF drainage and intravenous glucocorticoids. Generally speaking, surgery for intracranial tumors can be safely accomplished with the induction and maintenance regimen mentioned above, as well as normo- or hyperventilation and adequate vascular access (usually two peripheral intravenous catheters and an arterial catheter). ICP and CPP are of great concern for these cases. An arterial catheter is very helpful in monitoring CPP closely while also allowing the titration of Pa<span class="usmall">CO</span><sub>2</sub> (by revealing its gradient with end-tidal carbon dioxide via arterial blood gas measurement). Usually, patients are extubated in the operating room at the conclusion of the case.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen498">B. Pituitary Surgery</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although elevated ICP is of great importance for supratentorial and infratentorial masses, it is not usually a grave concern in pituitary surgery, as the sellar space usually has room to accommodate most tumors. Pituitary surgery is usually performed endoscopically and transnasally. Anesthetic concerns for pituitary surgery include optic chiasm compression (leading to cranial nerve III compression and classically a bitemporal hemianopsia), acromegaly, electrolyte and fluid disturbances caused by SIADH or DI, and inadvertent surgical trespass into the cavernous sinus or internal carotid artery. Patients with a sellar mass (usually a pituitary adenoma or a craniopharyngioma) may exhibit visual field defects. It is important to differentiate between organic and anesthetic causes of visual problems after surgery. Growth hormone&#x2013;secreting <a id="page638"></a>tumors can commonly cause acromegaly, which is vitally important to the anesthesiologist as airway and hemodynamic management can be much more difficult. Despite an adequate oral opening, acromegalic patients tend to have an abundance of pharyngeal soft tissue and a small glottic opening, which may make mask ventilation and intubation challenging and may require a smaller-sized endotracheal tube and awake fiberoptic intubation. Furthermore, long-standing acromegalics are prone to cardiac rhythm disturbances and cardiomyopathies, and caution with cardiac depressant medications is warranted.</p>
<p class="indent">SIADH is common with sellar tumors due to compression of the posterior pituitary and an oversecretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which may lead to intravascular volume overload and hyponatremia. Extracellular body water is usually normal, and edema or hypertension are usually not seen. Treatment of perioperative SIADH involves judicious water restriction, removing the underlying cause (the tumor), and demeclocycline (which is a long-acting inhibitor of ADH, but less helpful in the acute setting). Perioperatively, central DI is also occasionally seen (due to a lack of ADH secretion), the hallmark being a large, dilute urine output. Postoperative DI is usually short lived and can be treated with fluid restriction. Rarely is exogenous desmopressin needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Because accidental surgical entry into the cavernous sinus or internal carotid artery is a potential, albeit infrequent, complication of pituitary surgery, two intravenous catheters and an arterial catheter are recommended. Intraoperative hyperventilation is generally not used in pituitary surgery and may make the sellar structures more difficult to access endoscopically. Similarly, a lumbar subarachnoid catheter is sometimes placed before or after pituitary surgery, both to inject small amounts of sterile saline to facilitate surgical exposure and to drain CSF postoperatively to decrease CSF pressure where a dural sealant or fat graft has been used.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen499">C. Cerebral Aneurysm Surgery and Endovascular Treatment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Anesthesia for <strong><em>cerebral aneurysm</em></strong> clipping requires stable blood pressure so as not to rupture the aneurysm prior to exposure, to maintain CPP, and to have a plan in place in the event of intraoperative rupture. The maintenance regimen should allow neuromonitoring that is used to detect regional ischemia. During exposure of the aneurysm, burst suppression on the EEG is often sought (<strong><a href="#ff30-7">Figure 30.7</a></strong>) to decrease the impending ischemic burden on the brain from temporary occlusion of large cerebral vessels. Additional vasopressor may be required during this time. Prior to direct clipping of the aneurysmal neck, the surgeon may place temporary clips to &#x201C;soften&#x201D; the neck and make it more amenable to direct clipping while minimizing the chances of rupture. Alternatively, when temporary clips are anatomically difficult to place, adenosine 0.3 to 0.4&#x00A0;mg/kg may be safely given as a bolus to cause transient circulatory arrest and profound hypotension, allowing safe permanent clip application.<sup><a href="ch030-sec10.xhtml#bib9">9</a></sup></p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Adenosine Administration in Neurosurgery</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Inadvertent rupture is possible during dissection around the aneurysm. The plan for this must include the availability of blood products and adenosine for rescue. Thus, large bore intravenous access is required for these cases and central venous access is recommended. Arterial catheters are routinely used for aneurysm surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">The endovascular treatment of aneurysms involves femoral arterial access and coils deployed to the aneurysmal sac to cause thrombosis and eventual obliteration of the aneurysm. General anesthesia is used and movement should be prevented. An arterial catheter is needed to monitor the blood pressure closely and to obtain blood samples for coagulation measurements at repeated intervals, as heparin is given periodically. The anesthesiologist should communicate very closely with the interventionalist throughout the procedure, as any extravasation of dye into the brain parenchyma may be indicative vascular rupture. Coils may embolize to other parts of the brain. Thus, prompt neurologic examination at the procedure&#x2019;s conclusion is important.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen500">D. Arteriovenous Malformations</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Cerebral AVMs</em></strong> are congenital abnormalities in which a plexus of arteries and &#x201C;arterialized&#x201D; veins are bunched together and may lead to cerebral hemorrhage, headaches, or seizures, usually between the ages of 10 and 40&#x00A0;years. These lesions may be embolized in the interventional radiology suite (preoperatively or curatively), radiated, or surgically removed. More than in any other intracranial neurosurgical procedure, vascular access is of great importance and a central venous catheter is highly recommended. The greatest risk of AVM resection is bleeding, both intraoperatively and postoperatively, and strict control of blood pressure is required to maintain CPP without worsening blood loss from the resection bed. Blood products should be immediately available, and vasodilators are very often needed, especially at emergence. The phenomenon of normal perfusion pressure breakthrough is a type of autoregulatory inhibition caused by the AVM and affecting the surrounding &#x201C;normal&#x201D; brain, in which previously normal cerebral vessels are maximally vasodilated due to long-standing &#x201C;steal&#x201D; caused by the AVM. After the AVM has been resected, these &#x201C;vasoparalyzed&#x201D; vessels are unable to constrict, leading to cerebral hyperemia, cerebral congestion, headache, and possibly worsened postoperative bleeding. Neuromonitoring is increasingly being used for cerebral AVM resections. Arterial catheterization and careful induction and intubation, as described with cerebral aneurysms, are standard.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen501">E. Carotid Surgery</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Carotid endarterectomy</em></strong> is performed to remove carotid plaque that is &#x2265;70% occlusive. It can be performed either awake (regional technique) or asleep (general anesthesia), with neither technique proven to be superior in terms of neurologic outcome. Awake carotid surgery usually involves a superficial and sometimes deep cervical plexus block, along with low-dose analgesia and sedation <a id="page640"></a>(eg, remifentanil, propofol), while ensuring that the patient is responsive to commands and able to perform manual tasks on the contralateral side. Asleep carotid surgery employs general endotracheal anesthesia. Frequently some form of neuromonitoring is used (eg, EEG, SSEPs, cerebral oximetry), or the measurement of carotid stump pressure is performed (&#x003E;50&#x00A0;mm Hg is desirable) to ensure adequate CBF during cross-clamping. In either case, arterial blood pressure monitoring is preferred, as operative morbidity is generally due to neurologic complications, while mortality is usually due to cardiac complications, and blood pressure control is critical. During manipulation of the carotid baroreceptor, bradycardia is not uncommon, and the surgeon may infiltrate the carotid sinus with lidocaine to prevent this response. Surgical denervation of the carotid baroreceptor causes hypertension and tachycardia upon emergence, which must be tightly controlled. Because cerebral vessels distal to the carotid have been maximally vasodilated for a long period of time, autoregulation is not intact and a &#x201C;steal&#x201D; phenomenon can occur in which cerebral hyperemia and bleeding can potentially occur. Beta-blockers are helpful in this regard. Lastly, the anesthesiologist must be keenly aware of the potential for a postoperative neck hematoma, which may quickly compromise the airway. Immediate intubation, which may be more difficult, and surgical exploration of the wound is required.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen502">F. Epilepsy Surgery and Awake Craniotomy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Surgery for intractable epilepsy that is not responsive to medical management requires a keen understanding of the pharmacologic effects of both anesthetics and anticonvulsants. Anticonvulsants taken by the patient can induce liver enzymes to a great extent and generally cause a very high metabolism of muscle relaxants and opioids. This leads to a &#x201C;resistance&#x201D; to the effects of these drugs and the need for higher dosages. On the other hand, anesthetics have very mixed and variable excitatory and inhibitory effects on seizure activity, and if used improperly can be detrimental to seizure focus mapping. Generally speaking, benzodiazepines should be avoided when electrocorticography (ECoG) is planned. Induction of anesthesia with propofol, muscle relaxant, and opioid is acceptable. During maintenance of anesthesia and prior to ECoG, any anesthetic regimen that allows craniotomy is used, but 30 minutes prior to ECoG initiation, propofol infusion should be stopped and potent volatile anesthetic held to a minimum or stopped as well. To prevent awareness, scopolamine, nitrous oxide, and high-dose opioid infusion can be used with very little adverse effect on ECoG. In any case, the patient should be counseled about the possibility of intraoperative awareness. In some cases, methohexital or etomidate can be used to elicit seizure activity. Once ECoG is complete, a &#x201C;routine&#x201D; general anesthetic can be resumed during the resection.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Awake craniotomy</em></strong> has gained popularity in some institutions and is used in cases in which a cranial lesion lies adjacent to either &#x201C;eloquent,&#x201D; motor, or sensory cortex. The advantage of awake craniotomy lies in its ability to allow speech, motor, or sensory mapping in real time, hence facilitating a subtotal resection of the tumor and avoiding the loss of these functions. The anesthesiologist must be attentive to the patient&#x2019;s analgesic, ventilatory, and emotional needs. Thus, constant communication with the patient is of paramount importance. Generally, an arterial catheter is placed and very light sedation or analgesia (eg, propofol, remifentanil, dexmedetomidine) is used. A selective scalp nerve block may be performed preoperatively, either unilaterally or bilaterally, <a id="page641"></a>blocking the six nerves on each side that innervate the scalp and dura mater. The brain itself has no pain or sensory receptors, so only the scalp and dura require anesthesia.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen503">G. Endovascular Therapy for Acute Ischemic Stroke</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In cases of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in which large-vessel occlusion has occurred because of thrombosis, endovascular therapy (ie, mechanical thrombectomy) is sometimes indicated to restore blood flow to the ischemic penumbra and avoid secondary cerebral damage. During this &#x201C;brain attack,&#x201D; every moment is critical and every effort should be made to hasten the patient to the neurointerventional radiology suite, which may preclude a complete preoperative evaluation. In the setting of hypoxemia or an unprotected airway, general anesthesia with an endotracheal tube is indicated, whereas in a patient with adequate oxygenation and intact airway reflexes, Monitored Anesthesia Care may be preferred. With either anesthetic strategy, meticulous hemodynamic control is paramount, as most randomized, prospective studies have shown that functional neurologic outcome can be influenced by tight blood pressure control rather than by the anesthetic technique used. In this regard, an arterial catheter, placed rapidly or accessed by the proceduralist during groin access, is recommended whenever possible or feasible.</p>
<p class="indent">Prior to reperfusion (recanalization), higher systolic blood pressures should be maintained (140-180&#x00A0;mm Hg), which may require vasopressor support, especially in the setting of a greater depth of anesthesia. After recanalization has occurred, the blood pressure can be liberalized to a level of 120 to 140&#x00A0;mm Hg. Close communication with the proceduralist, with a clear consensus on hemodynamic goals, is critical throughout the procedure and into the post-procedure recovery phase.<sup><a href="ch030-sec10.xhtml#bib10">10</a></sup> As with other neuroendovascular procedures (eg, aneurysm coiling, AVM embolization), protamine should be immediately available to reverse a heparin effect should arterial perforation occur. Protamine is generally not indicated for routine reversal of heparin in these cases.</p>
