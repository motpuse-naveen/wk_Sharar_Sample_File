<p class="nonindent">Children are at increased risk of <strong><em>hypothermia</em></strong> under anesthesia; infants and, in particular, premature infants and neonates are at greatest risk. Similar to adults, the primary modes of heat loss are as follows:</p>
<ol class="u_num1b">
<li><span>Radiation</span></li>
<li><span>Evaporation</span></li>
<li><span>Convection</span></li>
<li><span>Conduction</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Neonates under anesthesia behave as poikilotherms; their temperature approaches that of their surroundings. Hypothermia can be prevented and normothermia maintained using a combination of strategies tailored to the individual patient. Warming the operating room prior to arrival (convection or radiation), forced air warming (convection), use of a circulating warm water mattress (conduction), heated humidified gases or humidified moisture exchanger (evaporation), and overhead infrared warming lights (radiation) are among the available methods.</p>
