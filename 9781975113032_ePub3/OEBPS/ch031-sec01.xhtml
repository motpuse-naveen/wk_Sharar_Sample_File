<h4 class="h4" id="sec194">I. Physiologic Changes of Pregnancy</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Pregnancy induces many <strong><em>physiologic changes</em></strong>, most of which are adaptations to support blood flow and oxygen delivery to the fetus.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen511">A. Hematologic Changes</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Blood volume increases by 40% to approximately 100&#x00A0;mL/kg; plasma volume increases by 40% to 50% and red blood cell volume by 20% to 30%, causing a physiologic <strong><em>anemia of pregnancy</em></strong> (<strong><a href="#tt31-1">Table 31.1</a></strong>). Blood viscosity is decreased, allowing easier flow to the fetus. Normal hemoglobin range during pregnancy is 10.5 to 14&#x00A0;g/dL and is lowest in the second trimester (<strong><a href="#tt31-2">Table 31.2</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The anemia of pregnancy is caused by a disproportionate increase in plasma volume relative to red cell volume.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Pregnancy is a prothrombotic state, and pregnant patients carry a greater risk of venous thromboembolism. Production of all clotting factors, except factors XI and XIII, increases. Fibrinogen levels significantly increase and are normally &#x003E;400&#x00A0;mg/dL in the third trimester. A secondary fibrinolysis occurs later in pregnancy, and coagulation changes resemble a state of compensated disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Platelet count may decrease during pregnancy due to dilution as well as increased consumption. Gestational thrombocytopenia is common, occurring in 8% of pregnancies, and is not associated with an increased risk of neuraxial hematoma.</p>
<p class="indent">Mild leukocytosis is normal during pregnancy. However, pregnancy is an immunosuppressed state, and pregnant patients do not tolerate the physiologic effects of systemic infection well, and mortality from sepsis is increased. In general, autoimmune diseases improve during pregnancy due to relative immunosuppression.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen512">B. Cardiovascular Changes</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Due to increased blood volume, stroke volume, and heart rate, cardiac output increases up to 50% by the end of the first trimester. During labor, cardiac output increases by another 50%, up to 80% over prelabor values immediately postpartum. Cardiovascular changes resolve several days postpartum. Systemic vascular resistance decreases, sometimes causing a mild decrease in blood pressure. Pregnant patients are less responsive to vasopressors and more sensitive to decreases in preload. After 20&#x00A0;weeks&#x2019; gestation, pregnant patients may experience <strong><em>supine hypotension syndrome</em></strong> when lying flat, because the gravid uterus can compress the inferior vena cava and decrease venous return. Therefore, left uterine displacement (LUD) is the preferred position for pregnant patients over 20&#x00A0;weeks&#x2019; gestation.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Left Uterine Displacement</strong></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen513">C. Respiratory Changes</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Oxygen consumption increases by 20% to 50% and minute ventilation by 50% at term. Minute ventilation increases mainly due to an increase in tidal volume and to a lesser extent respiratory rate. This physiologic hyperventilation decreases arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pa<span class="usmall">CO</span><sub>2</sub>) levels to 28 to 32&#x00A0;mm Hg and may cause a slight increase in arterial partial pressure of oxygen (Pa<span class="usmall">O</span><sub>2</sub>) levels. Compensatory metabolic acidosis occurs, bicarbonate levels are normally 18 to 22 mEq/L, and pH only slightly increases (7.45). Vital capacity and closing volume remain the same, but expiratory reserve volume and functional residual capacity decrease, making the pregnant patient quick to desaturate during periods of apnea, in particular in the supine position. A rightward shift in the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve occurs, facilitating oxygen transfer to the fetus.</p>

<p class="dify">Left uterine displacement should be used for pregnant patients over 20&#x00A0;weeks&#x2019; gestation to prevent compression of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen514">D. Airway Changes</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Mucosal edema and capillary engorgement occur as pregnancy progresses, and Mallampati class increases at term. The incidence of difficult mask ventilation and laryngoscopy also increases, with difficult or failed intubation occurring in one of 224 pregnant patients versus one of 2500 in the general surgical population.<sup><a href="ch031-sec09.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> A longer second stage of labor and preeclampsia are both associated with increased <strong><em>airway edema</em></strong>. Proper positioning and preoxygenation assume additional importance during induction of general anesthesia and intubation of pregnant versus nonpregnant patients (<strong><a href="#ff31-1">Figure 31.1</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The normal arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pa<span class="small">CO</span><sub>2</sub>) during pregnancy is 28 to 32&#x00A0;mm Hg.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen515">E. Gastrointestinal Changes</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The gravid uterus causes <strong><em>mechanical gastroesophageal sphincter dysfunction</em></strong>. Progesterone decreases lower esophageal sphincter tone, predisposing pregnant patients to reflux of stomach contents into the oropharynx. In addition, the gravid uterus increases abdominal pressure and, thus, intragastric pressure, furthering risk of reflux of stomach contents. Gastrin secretion by the placenta causes greater acidity of stomach contents. Finally, progesterone slows gastric emptying and gastrointestinal mobility. Pregnant women often have a gastric volume of over 25&#x00A0;mL with pH&#x00A0;&#x003C;&#x00A0;2.5, both of which are associated with aspiration pneumonitis syndrome. Administration of a nonparticulate antacid is the only reliable way to change gastric content pH and possibly reduce the chance of aspiration pneumonitis syndrome should aspiration occur.</p>

<p class="dify">The incidence of difficult mask ventilation and laryngoscopy is greater in pregnant patients than in the general surgical population.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen516">F. Neurologic and Musculoskeletal Changes</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) decreases by 40% during pregnancy, possibly due to elevated progesterone levels, and returns to baseline by 1&#x00A0;week postpartum. Pregnant women are also more sensitive to neuraxial local anesthetics and require lower doses than nonpregnant patients. Epidural space volume is decreased due to epidural vein engorgement, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pH is decreased. Ligamentous relaxation occurs, and lumbar lordosis is accentuated, raising the intercristal line from L4-5 in nonpregnant patients to L3-4 in pregnant patients.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen517">G. Endocrine Changes</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>1. Glucose Control</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pregnancy is a diabetogenic state, due to human placental lactogen&#x2019;s anti-insulin effects. Routine screening for gestational diabetes is done via a carbohydrate load between 24 and 26&#x00A0;weeks. Women with gestational or pregestational diabetes are at greater risk for fetal macrosomia and pregnancy complications. Tight glucose control during labor is the standard of care for diabetic women, with goal blood sugar range between 80 and 110&#x00A0;mg/dL in order to avoid neonatal hypoglycemia.</p>
<h6 class="h6">2. Thyroid</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Human chorionic gonadotropin is similar in structure to thyroid-stimulating hormone and causes thyroid hormone levels to increase during pregnancy. <a id="page652"></a>Estrogen stimulates production of thyroid-binding globulin, allowing more thyroid hormone to circulate.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen518">H. Renal and Hepatic Changes</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Blood flow to the kidneys and renal autoregulation remains unchanged during pregnancy as long as blood pressure remains stable. Increased glomerular filtration rate and decreased creatinine occur due to increases in cardiac output, and serum creatinine over 0.8 is abnormal. Proteinuria is common, as is asymptomatic bacteriuria. Ureteral tone decreases and asymptomatic bacteriuria can lead to pyelonephritis. Therefore, urine is screened for infection during routine prenatal visits.</p>
<p class="indent">Hepatic blood flow is not altered during pregnancy. Elevated alkaline phosphatase levels are seen due to secretion by the placenta. Liver transaminase levels are unchanged. Plasma osmolality is lower, leading to tissue edema. Pseudocholinesterase levels decrease, without much clinical significance. Clotting factor production increases. Cholestasis of pregnancy can occur due to the effects of estrogen and causes pruritus and an increased risk of stillbirth.</p>
