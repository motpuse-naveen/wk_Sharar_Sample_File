<h5 class="h5" id="sen323">A. Head and Neck</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Head and neck blocks can be used for a variety of procedures including carotid endarterectomy, awake craniotomy, and plastic and maxillofacial surgeries. Only a few landmark-based techniques will be discussed here.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen324">B. Supraorbital and Supratrochlear Nerve Blocks</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1) supplies the supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves, which provide sensory innervation to the anterior scalp. The supraorbital nerve can be blocked by injecting local anesthetic near the supraorbital foramen above the eyebrow. The supratrochlear nerve can be blocked by extending this injection medially approximately 1&#x00A0;cm.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Infraorbital Block</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The infraorbital block is useful for providing analgesia after cleft lip repair. This terminal branch of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (V2) can be blocked by injecting local anesthetic near the infraorbital foramen inferior to the eye.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Superficial Cervical Plexus Block</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The ventral rami of the C2-C4 form the superficial and deep cervical plexuses. The superficial cervical plexus comprises four nerves (supraclavicular, transverse cervical, greater auricular, and lesser occipital) and can be located posterolateral to the sternocleidomastoid at the level of the cricoid cartilage. The greater auricular and lesser occipital nerves provide sensory innervation to the lateral and posterolateral scalp, respectively.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Greater Occipital Nerve Block</h6>
<p class="nonindent">To provide analgesia for the posterior scalp, the greater occipital nerve (dorsal rami C2) can be blocked along the superior nuchal line lateral to the occipital protuberance and adjacent (typically medial) to the occipital artery.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen325">C. Brachial Plexus Blockade</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The brachial plexus consists of spinal roots C5-T1 with a variable contribution from C4 and T2. There are four major approaches to blockade of the brachial plexus: interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and axillary (<strong><a href="#ff21-2">Figure 21.2</a></strong>).</p>

<p class="video1" id="vid21-1"><strong>VIDEO 21.1</strong></p>
<p class="video2"><strong>Interscalene Nerve Block</strong></p>
<h6 class="h6">Interscalene Block</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The primary use of the interscalene block is for shoulder surgery (eg, total shoulder arthroplasty, rotator cuff repair, arthroscopic shoulder surgery). The interscalene approach targets the nerves of the upper brachial plexus (C5-C7). Inferior nerve roots of the brachial plexus (C8-T1) are least likely to be blocked (<strong><a href="#ff21-2">Figure 21.2</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">Known side effects of the interscalene block include phrenic nerve paralysis, Horner syndrome, and recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis. Phrenic nerve paralysis has been reported in up to 100% of patients, yet with the introduction of ultrasound, the incidence has been reduced considerably to as low as 13%.<sup><a href="ch021-sec05.xhtml#bib3">3</a>,<a href="ch021-sec05.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> Horner <a id="page448"></a>syndrome results from blockade of the cervical sympathetic chain, as seen in up to half of patients who receive interscalene blocks. The incidence of hoarse voice from recurrent laryngeal nerve block is on the order of 10% to 20%.</p>

<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The introduction of ultrasound-guided needle placement has reduced the incidence of phrenic nerve blockade from nearly 100% to as low as 13% during interscalene block.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The interscalene approach targets the level of the distal roots or proximal trunks of the brachial plexus. Two of the primary nerves of the shoulder derived from the C5-C6 nerve roots, suprascapular nerve and axillary nerve, are blocked by this approach. The supraclavicular nerve (C4), which provides the cutaneous innervation for the top of the shoulder, is often blocked by the interscalene approach.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to perform an ultrasound-guided interscalene block, the patient is positioned in a near-seated position of 70&#x00B0; to 90&#x00B0; (<strong><a href="#ff21-3">Figure 21.3</a></strong>). Ultrasound scanning with a high-frequency probe begins above the midpoint of the clavicle where the subclavian artery is located. The nerves of the brachial plexus will be located lateral to the subclavian artery and should be traced to the level of the cricoid cartilage, which corresponds to the level of the C6 vertebrae. The needle is inserted posterior to the ultrasound probe for the in-plane approach (<strong><a href="#ff21-4">Figure 21.4</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">When performing a landmark-based interscalene block, the interscalene groove should be palpated lateral to the clavicular head of the sternocleidomastoid at the level of the cricoid cartilage (C6). The needle should be advanced 60&#x00B0; to the sagittal plane until motor response is obtained at the deltoid, biceps, or triceps at &#x003C;0.5&#x00A0;mA.</p>

<p class="video1" id="vid21-2"><strong>VIDEO 21.2</strong></p>
<p class="video2"><strong>Supraclavicular Nerve Block</strong></p>
<h6 class="h6">Supraclavicular Block</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The supraclavicular block is indicated for elbow, wrist, and hand surgery. The supraclavicular block can also be used for shoulder surgery. But it tends to miss the C4 distribution and may require a superficial cervical plexus block if anesthesia of the top of the shoulder is needed. The supraclavicular block targets the distal trunks and divisions (<strong><a href="#ff21-2">Figure 21.2</a></strong>).</p>
<a id="page449"></a>
<div class="figureu5" id="ff21-5"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff21-5.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="ucaption"><span class="u_fignum">Figure&#160;21.5</span> Positioning for the ultrasound-guided supraclavicular block.</figcaption></figure></div>

MT, middle trunk; IT, inferior trunk; SA, subclavian artery; ST, superior trunk. The asterisk (*) signifies the &#x201C;corner pocket&#x201D; injection target.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Side effects are similar to the interscalene block. Phrenic nerve paralysis is possible, although it occurs about half as often as with an interscalene block. Pneumothorax is possible, but it is less common when ultrasound is used.</p>
<p class="indent">To perform an ultrasound-guided supraclavicular block, ultrasound scanning begins with a high-frequency ultrasound probe at the midpoint of the clavicle with the ultrasound probe angled vertically, similar to the start of the interscalene block (<strong><a href="#ff21-5">Figure 21.5</a></strong>). The brachial plexus appears as a &#x201C;bundle of grapes&#x201D; lateral and superficial to the subclavian artery (<strong><a href="#ff21-6">Figure 21.6</a></strong>). The target location for the needle tip is posterior and slightly lateral to the subclavian artery and has been described as the &#x201C;corner pocket&#x201D; location.<sup><a href="ch021-sec05.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Due to the risk of pneumothorax being as high as 6% with the landmark technique, other blocks such as the axillary or infraclavicular block can be utilized when ultrasound is not available.<sup><a href="ch021-sec05.xhtml#bib6">6</a></sup></p>
<h6 class="h6">Infraclavicular Block</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The infraclavicular block can be used interchangeably with the supraclavicular block for wrist and hand surgery but often spares the suprascapular nerve distribution necessary for shoulder surgery. Compared with the supraclavicular block, the infraclavicular block has virtually no risk of phrenic nerve paralysis and can be used in patients with preexisting lung disease. The infraclavicular block targets the level of the medial, lateral, and posterior cords (<strong><a href="#ff21-2">Figure 21.2</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">When performing an ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block, scanning should begin in the parasagittal plane medial to the coracoid process and inferior to the clavicle (<strong><a href="#ff21-7">Figure 21.7</a></strong>). The axillary artery is located deep to the pectoralis major and minor muscles. The target is the posterior cord, which is immediately deep to the subclavian artery (<strong><a href="#ff21-8">Figure 21.8</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">A landmark-based technique can be alternatively used. The needle insertion site is immediately inferior to the clavicle, 1 to 2&#x00A0;cm medial to the coracoid process. The needle angle is perpendicular to the skin with a slight (15&#x00B0;-30&#x00B0;) <a id="page450"></a>caudad angle. The desired end points are either extension of the hand- or elbow-indicated posterior cord stimulation or flexion at the fingers, indicating medial cord stimulation. Biceps flexion indicates lateral cord stimulation and has been associated with a high failure rate of the block.<sup><a href="ch021-sec05.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup></p>

<h6 class="h6"><strong>Axillary Block</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">The axillary block is a more distal approach to the brachial plexus when compared with the infraclavicular and supraclavicular blocks. The axillary block is performed at the level of the terminal branches of the brachial plexus (<strong><a href="#ff21-2">Figure 21.2</a></strong>). The musculocutaneous, median, ulnar, and radial nerves are blocked, although the musculocutaneous nerve may require a separate injection. Given that the terminal branches are individually visible when using ultrasound, the axillary block can be used as a rescue block when a particular distribution is missed with an infraclavicular or supraclavicular block (<strong><a href="#ff21-9">Figures 21.9</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#ff21-10">21.10</a></strong>). The musculocutaneous nerve terminates as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm and may be missed by the axillary block. For this reason, a separate injection targeting the musculocutaneous nerve may be necessary for surgery involving the lateral wrist.</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen326">D. Terminal Upper Extremity Nerve Blocks</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The terminal branches of the brachial plexus can be blocked individually using more distal approaches. The use of ultrasound to specifically target terminal branches with the axillary approach has made the use of distal rescue blocks less common. Specific circumstances can make these blocks ideal, such as a patient requiring a rescue block from an inadequate supraclavicular block who cannot abduct his or her arm.</p>
<p class="indent">Using ultrasound, the median nerve can be blocked at the antecubital fossa. The median nerve appears as a hypoechoic structure medial to the brachial<a id="page451"></a> artery. The radial nerve can be located on the anterior surface of the elbow, 1 to 2&#x00A0;cm lateral to the biceps tendon, and appears hypoechoic, similar to the median nerve. Nerve stimulation can be used to confirm identification by eliciting a radial nerve response such as wrist or finger extension. The ulnar nerve can be localized at the mid-forearm. The nerve will appear hyperechoic, just medial to the pulsating ulnar artery.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen327">E. Intravenous Regional Anesthesia</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Commonly known as a <strong><em>Bier block</em></strong>, the <strong><em>intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA)</em></strong> duration of action is mainly limited by a patient&#x2019;s ability to tolerate tourniquet pain. Therefore, IVRA is indicated for surgeries lasting approximately 40 minutes or less that do not require a block for postoperative analgesia. IVRA is commonly used for carpal tunnel releases, trigger finger releases, and wrist arthroscopy.</p>
<p class="indent">An intravenous (IV) catheter is placed at a distal location of the operative hand. A double tourniquet is placed on the upper arm with the proximal and distal tourniquets clearly identified. An elastic bandage is then used to exsanguinate the arm, followed by inflation of the distal tourniquet to 250&#x00A0;mm Hg. Next, the proximal tourniquet is inflated, followed by deflation of the distal tourniquet. The elastic bandage is removed, and a dose of 3&#x00A0;mg/kg of lidocaine is then injected. The IV catheter is removed prior to surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient will often begin to complain of dull tourniquet pain between 20 and 40 minutes after tourniquet inflation. Treatment of tourniquet pain may require inflation of the distal tourniquet followed by deflation of the proximal tourniquet. If surgery is completed prior to 20 minutes, the tourniquet should remain inflated until at least 20 minutes have passed due to the association with toxic IV concentration of local anesthetic when tourniquets are released after less than 20 minutes. If a patient begins to experience symptoms of local anesthetic systemic neurotoxicity (eg, tinnitus, perioral numbness), the tourniquet should be reinflated and deflated in a cyclic manner until symptoms no longer occur with deflation. After 45 minutes, the tourniquet can be released with minimal risk of systemic neurotoxicity.</p>
<a id="page452"></a>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen328">F. Intercostal Nerve Blocks</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Intercostal nerve blocks</em></strong> are useful in an array of acute or chronic pain settings from rib fractures to herpes zoster &#x201C;shingles&#x201D;. The intercostal nerve travels in between the internal and innermost intercostal muscles and lies inferior to the intercostal artery and vein, which are inferior and deep to the rib. Due to the proximity to these vessels and high rate of vascular uptake of local anesthetic, patients should be adequately monitored for local anesthetic systemic toxicity.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen329">G. Paravertebral Nerve Blocks</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Bounded medially by the intervertebral foramina and lateral spine, anteriorly by the parietal pleura, and posteriorly by the superior costotransverse ligament, the thoracic paravertebral space houses the spinal nerve root as it splits into dorsal and ventral rami. It is contiguous medially with the epidural space via foramina, laterally to the intercostal nerve and vessels, and the cephalo-caudad paravertebral spaces (<strong><a href="#ff21-11">Figure 21.11</a></strong>). When unilateral analgesia is desired (eg, for breast or thoracic surgery), local anesthetic can be injected via one large volume injection or multiple smaller volume injections at adjacent levels. When performed under ultrasound guidance, the parietal pleura appears to be &#x201C;pushed down&#x201D; by the spread of local anesthetic during injection. Potential complications include pneumothorax, epidural or intrathecal spread of local anesthetic, bleeding, and infection.</p>

<a id="page453"></a>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen330">H. Erector Spinae Plane Block</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Similar to the paravertebral block, the erector spinae plane (ESP) block can provide unilateral analgesia for pain located at the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar levels but has been most utilized for thoracic or abdominal surgeries.<sup><a href="ch021-sec05.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup> It is performed by locating the erector spinae muscle lateral to the spine and injecting local anesthetic deep to the muscle, superficial to the transverse process. The local anesthetic will spread to a few craniocaudal dermatomes depending on volume and dose. In contrast with the paravertebral block, the ESP block is technically less challenging but cannot be used for surgical anesthesia.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Ultrasound-guided Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) Block</strong></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen331">I. Transversus Abdominis Plane Block</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In the anterior abdomen, deep to a fascial plane that lies between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles, there is a network of terminal branches of the ventral rami of the T7-L1 nerve roots and their communicating nerves (<strong><a href="#ff21-12">Figure 21.12</a></strong>). The plane extends medially to the rectus sheath, laterally to the latissimus dorsi, cranially to the rib cage, and caudally to the iliac crest. Injection of local anesthetic at this location provides analgesia to the abdominal wall and skin and can be useful following or preceding laparoscopic or umbilical surgery. This block is most often performed under ultrasound guidance, shown in <strong><a href="#ff21-13">Figure 21.13</a></strong> lateral to the rectus sheath in the T10 dermatome. Care must be taken not to traverse the peritoneum, which lies deep to the transversus muscle.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen332">J. Inguin al Nerve Block</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves are also located in the transversus plane in the anterior abdomen, which originate from L1. Injection around <a id="page454"></a>these nerves can facilitate analgesia following inguinal or scrotal surgery when combined with the genitofemoral nerve block. Optimal image view is obtained when the probe is aligned on an axis between the anterior superior iliac spine and umbilicus. Lateral injection can be preferred to avoid incidental peritoneal injury. Doppler can be useful in avoiding inadvertent vascular injection as small vessels often lie adjacent to these nerves.</p>
