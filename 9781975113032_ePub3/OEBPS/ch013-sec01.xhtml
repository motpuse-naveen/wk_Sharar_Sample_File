<h4 class="h4" id="sec78">I. Catecholamines</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The <em>&#x03B1;</em>, <em>&#x03B2;</em>, and dopamine adrenergic receptor subtypes are responsible for mediating the cardiovascular effects of endogenous (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine) and synthetic (dobutamine, isoproterenol) catecholamines. These drugs activate <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors located on the sarcolemmal membrane of atrial and ventricular myocytes to varying degrees. This <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor stimulation causes positive chronotropic (heart rate), dromotropic (conduction velocity), inotropic (contractility), and lusitropic (relaxation) effects. The <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor is coupled to a stimulatory guanine nucleotide&#x2013;binding (G<sub>s</sub>) protein that activates the key intracellular enzyme adenylyl cyclase, thereby accelerating formation of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP; <strong><a href="#ff13-1">Figure 13.1</a></strong>). Three major consequences result from activation of this signaling cascade: (1) more calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) is available for contractile activation; (2) the efficacy of activator Ca<sup>2+</sup> at troponin C (TnC) of the contractile apparatus is enhanced; and (3) removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the contractile apparatus and the sarcoplasm after contraction is accelerated. The first two of these actions produce a direct increase in contractility, whereas the third results in more rapid myocardial relaxation during early diastole. Treatment of acute or chronic left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction is the primary reason for the perioperative use of catecholamines. It is noteworthy that the efficacy of catecholamines under these clinical conditions is affected by the relative density and functional integrity of the <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor and its signaling cascade because receptor downregulation and abnormal intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis are characteristic features of heart failure.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">The vasoactive effects of catecholamines in other perfusion territories are dependent on the tissue-specific distribution of <em>&#x03B1;</em>- and <em>&#x03B2;</em>-adrenoceptor subtypes. Differences in each catecholamine&#x2019;s chemical structure and its relative selectivity for adrenoceptors also influence the peripheral vascular actions of these medications. This selectivity is often dose related; dopamine provides a useful<a id="page264"></a> pedagogical illustration of this principle. Low doses of this catecholamine predominantly stimulate dopamine subtype 1 and 2 (DA<sub>1</sub> and DA<sub>2</sub>, respectively) receptors, causing arterial vasodilation, but progressively larger doses sequentially activate <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>- and <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors, augmenting contractility and causing arterial vasoconstriction, respectively. The <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors are major regulators of vasomotor tone as a result of their location in arteries, arterioles, and veins. Thus, catecholamines that exert substantial <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist activity (eg, norepinephrine) increase systemic vascular resistance and reduce venous capacitance through arterial and venous vasoconstriction, respectively. This <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor&#x2013;mediated vasoconstriction occurs through phospholipase C-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate signaling through an inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding (G<sub>i</sub>) protein (<strong><a href="#ff13-2">Figure 13.2</a></strong>). This cascade opens Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, releases Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores (sarcoplasmic reticulum and calmodulin), and activates several Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinases. Collectively, these actions increase intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and cause contraction of vascular smooth muscle cell. <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors are the major target for catecholamines in cutaneous blood vessels, whereas <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors predominate in skeletal muscle. Stimulation of the <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor subtype produces arteriolar vasodilation via adenylyl cyclase&#x2013;mediated signaling, thereby increasing blood flow to skeletal muscle.</p>

<p class="indent">The actions of each specific catecholamine on heart rate, myocardial contractility, and LV preload and afterload combine to determine its overall effect on arterial pressure (<strong><a href="#tt13-1">Table 13.1</a></strong>). For example, if a catecholamine acts primarily through the <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor (eg, norepinephrine), an increase in arterial pressure will most likely be observed because enhanced arterial and venous vasomotor tone increases systemic vascular resistance (greater afterload) and augments venous return to the heart (increased preload), respectively. In contrast, a catecholamine with <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>- and <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor activity and little or no effect on the <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor (eg, isoproterenol) would be expected to modestly decrease arterial pressure because reductions in systemic vascular resistance offset increases in cardiac output caused by tachycardia and enhanced myocardial contractility. All catecholamines have the potential to cause detrimental increases in myocardial oxygen consumption in patients with flow-limiting coronary artery stenoses and may contribute to the development of acute myocardial ischemia. As a result, the use of catecholamines to support LV function in patients with coronary artery disease complicated by congestive heart failure should be approached with caution. Thus, it should come as no surprise that a drug that reduces LV afterload, and not one that causes a positive inotropic effect, is usually chosen first to improve cardiac output in a patient with coronary artery disease and LV systolic dysfunction.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen190">A. Epinephrine</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Epinephrine is an endogenous catecholamine that exerts its cardiovascular effects by activating <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-, <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-, and <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors. Epinephrine stimulates <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors located on the cell membranes of sinoatrial node cells and cardiac myocytes to produce positive chronotropic and inotropic effects, respectively. Epinephrine-induced activation of <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors also enhances the rate and extent of myocardial relaxation, thereby facilitating greater LV filling during early diastole. The combination of these actions on heart rate and LV systolic and diastolic function causes dramatic increases in cardiac output. The increase in heart rate initially observed during an infusion of epinephrine may subsequently be attenuated to some extent as baroreceptor-mediated reflexes are activated. As a result, epinephrine is especially useful for the treatment of acute LV failure during cardiac surgery because it predictably increases cardiac output. Epinephrine also enhances cardiac output and oxygen delivery without causing deleterious increases in heart rate in septic,<a id="page267"></a> hypotensive patients. However, epinephrine&#x2019;s efficacy as a positive inotropic medication may be limited because the catecholamine stimulates the development of atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. Epinephrine increases conduction velocity and reduces refractory period in the atrioventricular (AV) node, His bundle, Purkinje fibers, and ventricular muscle. The positive dromotropic effect of epinephrine on AV nodal conduction may produce supraventricular tachyarrhythmias or cause marked increases in ventricular rate in the presence of atrial flutter or fibrillation. These adverse consequences may inadvertently result in hypotension because profound tachycardia reduces LV filling time and compromises coronary perfusion. Irritability in other parts of the conduction system may also precipitate ventricular arrhythmias including premature ventricular contractions, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, especially in the presence of a preexisting arrhythmogenic substrate (eg, myocardial ischemia, cardiomyopathy).</p>
<p class="indent">Epinephrine causes vasoconstriction in the cutaneous, splanchnic, and renal perfusion territories through its effects at the <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor, but the catecholamine also simultaneously produces vasodilation in the skeletal muscle circulation as a result of <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor activation. Thus, epinephrine&#x2019;s overall effect on blood flow is dependent on the organ-specific distribution of <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>- and <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors. These actions are also dose dependent: lower doses of epinephrine stimulate <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors to cause peripheral vasodilation and modestly reduce arterial pressure, whereas higher doses activate <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors to increase systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure. A high density of <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors is also present in the venous circulation, and as a result, epinephrine produces venoconstriction and augments venous return. Epinephrine also causes vasoconstriction of the pulmonary arterial tree and increases pulmonary arterial pressures through <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor activation. The <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>- and <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors are present in the coronary circulation, but selective activation of either of these receptor subtypes does not play a major role in determining coronary blood flow during administration of epinephrine. Instead, epinephrine-induced increases in coronary perfusion occur almost exclusively because of metabolic autoregulation: increases in myocardial oxygen demand resulting from increases in heart rate, contractility, preload, and afterload are responsible for coronary vasodilation. Nevertheless, epinephrine may cause epicardial coronary vasoconstriction and reduce coronary blood flow in situations where maximal coronary vasodilation is present (eg, acute myocardial ischemia distal to a severe coronary stenosis) via direct stimulation of <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors. The vasoconstrictor properties of epinephrine make it useful for a number of other clinical applications. Subcutaneous infiltration of epinephrine is used to substantially reduce bleeding during dental, otolaryngology, and plastic surgery procedures. The mixture of a local anesthetic (eg, lidocaine) with a dilute concentration of epinephrine reduces blood loss during tumescent anesthesia for liposuction. Anesthesiologists often use epinephrine as a vasoconstrictor to delay the absorption of local anesthetics to prolong the duration of neuraxial anesthesia or peripheral nerve blocks. This effect also decreases serum local anesthetic concentration and reduces the risk of systemic toxicity. Mucosal vasoconstriction resulting from inhalation of aerosolized racemic epinephrine is frequently used to treat airway edema associated with prolonged endotracheal intubation, airway trauma, or croup.</p>
<p class="indent">Prior administration of <em>&#x03B1;</em>- or <em>&#x03B2;</em>-adrenoceptor antagonists influences the cardiovascular effects of epinephrine. For example, epinephrine causes greater<a id="page268"></a> increases in systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure when administered after the nonselective <em>&#x03B2;</em>-blocker propranolol because <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor&#x2013;mediated arterial vasodilation no longer opposes <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor&#x2013;induced vasoconstriction. Established <em>&#x03B2;</em>-blockade also competitively inhibits <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor activation by epinephrine, thereby attenuating the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of the catecholamine. Such a competitive blockade may only be overcome by larger doses of epinephrine. Indeed, the hemodynamic effects of epinephrine may be similar to those of the pure <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (see section that follows) in the presence of complete <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>- and <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor blockade. Conversely, epinephrine&#x2019;s <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor&#x2013;meditated vasodilation is unmasked in the presence of <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor blockade, which may cause hypotension when the catecholamine is administered under these conditions.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">In patients with complete <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>- and <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-blockade, epinephrine produces hemodynamic effects similar to a pure <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist like phenylephrine.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen191">B. Norepinephrine</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Norepinephrine is the neurotransmitter that is released from postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system. This catecholamine activates <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-, <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub>-, and <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors similar to epinephrine, but norepinephrine exerts few if any effects on the <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor. As a result, norepinephrine enhances myocardial contractility and causes intense arterial vasoconstriction. These actions dramatically increase arterial pressure, but cardiac output remains largely unchanged. In contrast, a pure <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist (eg, phenylephrine) causes predictable, dose-related decreases in cardiac output because simultaneous increases in contractility mediated through the <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor do not occur. Unlike epinephrine, norepinephrine usually does not produce tachycardia because elevated arterial pressure activates baroreceptor-mediated reflexes and, in so doing, mitigates the direct positive chronotropic actions of <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor stimulation. In general, greater increases in systemic vascular resistance and diastolic arterial pressure are observed during administration of norepinephrine compared with similar doses of epinephrine. Norepinephrine also causes constriction of venous capacitance vessels through <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor stimulation, thereby increasing venous return and augmenting stroke volume.</p>
<p class="indent">Norepinephrine is especially useful for treatment of refractory hypotension resulting from pronounced vasodilation. For example, norepinephrine increases arterial pressure, cardiac index, and urine output in patients with sepsis. Norepinephrine is also useful for the treatment of vasoplegic syndrome, a hypotensive state characterized by low systemic vascular resistance that sometimes occurs during prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Norepinephrine increases coronary perfusion pressure in patients with severe coronary artery disease, but the drug increases myocardial oxygen demand and may cause spasm of internal mammary or radial artery grafts used during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery through <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor activation. Either of these adverse effects may contribute to the development of acute myocardial ischemia. Administration of norepinephrine is associated with ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, but arrhythmogenic effects of this catecholamine are less than those of epinephrine. As a result, it may be appropriate to substitute norepinephrine for epinephrine when treating cardiogenic shock in the presence of hemodynamically significant atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. Norepinephrine stimulates pulmonary arterial <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors and produces dose-related increases in pulmonary arterial pressures that may precipitate right ventricular (RV) dysfunction because the relatively thin-walled RV is less able to tolerate acute elevations in<a id="page269"></a> afterload than the thicker, more muscular LV. Addition of a selective inhaled pulmonary vasodilator (eg, nitric oxide, epoprostenol) may be useful to attenuate norepinephrine&#x2019;s actions as a direct pulmonary vasoconstrictor when the drug is used to treat LV dysfunction in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Dose-dependent decreases in hepatic, skeletal muscle, splanchnic, and renal blood flow occur during administration of norepinephrine via <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor activation when blood pressure is normal or modestly reduced, but in the presence of profound hypotension (eg, sepsis), norepinephrine increases perfusion pressure and blood flow to these vascular beds. Nevertheless, sustained reductions in renal and splanchnic blood flow represent a major limitation of prolonged use of norepinephrine. The endogenous catecholamine should be administered through a central venous catheter to avoid the possibility of tissue necrosis in the event that peripheral extravasation occurs.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen192">C. Dopamine</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Dopamine is the biochemical precursor of norepinephrine and differentially activates several adrenergic and dopaminergic receptor subtypes in a dose-related manner. Low doses (typically below 3&#x00A0;&#x03BC;g/kg/min) of dopamine selectively increase renal and splanchnic blood flow via activation of DA<sub>1</sub> receptors and also reduce norepinephrine release from autonomic nervous system ganglia and adrenergic neurons through a DA<sub>2</sub> receptor&#x2013;mediated mechanism. These combined effects produce a modest decline in arterial pressure. Moderate doses (3-8&#x00A0;&#x03BC;g/kg/min) of dopamine activate both <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>- and <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors, whereas high doses (in excess of 10&#x00A0;&#x03BC;g/kg/min) almost exclusively act on <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors to increase arterial pressure through arteriolar vasoconstriction. Although easily understood, this simplistic dose-response description of dopamine pharmacodynamics is strictly incorrect because differences in receptor density and regulation, drug interactions, and patient variability cause a broad range of clinical responses to the catecholamine. For example, low doses of dopamine were once thought to provide renal protection through DA<sub>1</sub> receptor&#x2013;mediated increases in renal blood flow alone, but it is now clear that even low doses of dopamine also stimulate <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>- and <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors that may attenuate the catecholamine&#x2019;s intended dopaminergic effect. Conversely, renal blood flow and urine output may be maintained (and not decreased) during administration of higher doses of dopamine because DA<sub>1</sub> receptors continue to be activated despite a predominant <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist effect. Such varied responses may explain, at least in part, why dopamine fails to consistently provide renal protective effects despite causing modest increases in renal perfusion and urine output.</p>
<p class="indent">Dopamine continues to be used for inotropic support in patients with acute LV dysfunction, although we prefer to use more potent catecholamines with more predictable pharmacodynamic characteristics in our practice. Activation of <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors is responsible for increases in myocardial contractility produced by the drug. Dopamine also stimulates arterial and venous <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors, thereby increasing LV afterload and enhancing venous return, respectively. These actions augment arterial pressure. The use of dopamine for the treatment of hypotension associated with depressed contractile function may be limited to some degree in patients with preexisting pulmonary hypertension or elevated preload because dopamine increases right atrial, mean pulmonary arterial, and pulmonary capillary occlusion pressures. Infusion of an arterial vasodilator (eg, sodium nitroprusside) may be used to mitigate the increases in LV afterload associated with administration of dopamine and, in<a id="page270"></a> so doing, may further augment cardiac output. However, administration of an inotrope-vasodilator (&#x201C;inodilator&#x201D;) such as milrinone has largely replaced this &#x201C;dopamine plus nitroprusside&#x201D; approach. Like epinephrine and norepinephrine, dopamine increases myocardial oxygen consumption and may worsen myocardial ischemia in the presence of hemodynamically significant coronary stenoses.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen193">D. Dobutamine</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine composed of two stereoisomers (&#x2212; and +), both of which stimulate <em>&#x03B2;</em>-adrenoceptors, whereas these stereoisomers produce opposing agonist and antagonist effects on <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors. As a result, dobutamine causes potent <em>&#x03B2;</em>-adrenoceptor stimulation but exerts little or no effect on <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors when administered at infusion rates less than 5&#x00A0;&#x03BC;g/kg/min. This unique pharmacology allows dobutamine to enhance myocardial contractility and simultaneously reduce arterial vasomotor tone through activation of <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>- and <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors, respectively. These properties combine to substantially increase cardiac output in normal and failing hearts. Notably, the isomer of dobutamine begins to stimulate the <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor at infusion rates greater than 5&#x00A0;&#x03BC;g/kg/min, an action that limits the magnitude of <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor&#x2013;mediated vasodilation. This effect preserves LV preload, afterload, and arterial pressure; sustains increases in cardiac output; and may serve to attenuate profound baroreceptor reflex&#x2013;mediated tachycardia that might otherwise occur. Despite this latter effect, dobutamine often markedly increases heart rate by direct chronotropic effects resulting from <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor stimulation. Indeed, dobutamine causes significantly higher heart rates than epinephrine at equivalent values of cardiac index in patients after coronary artery surgery. Dobutamine-induced tachycardia and enhanced contractility directly increase myocardial oxygen consumption and may cause &#x201C;demand&#x201D; myocardial ischemia in patients with flow limiting coronary stenoses. The propensity for dobutamine to produce demand myocardial ischemia under these circumstances is the underlying principle behind dobutamine stress echocardiography as a diagnostic tool for the detection of coronary artery disease because regional wall motion abnormalities in the affected coronary perfusion territories occur in response to the transient myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch. Conversely, dobutamine may reduce heart rate in patients with decompensated heart failure because increases in cardiac output and systemic oxygen delivery resulting from administration of the drug are capable of decreasing the chronically elevated sympathetic nervous system tone that occurs in heart failure. Dobutamine may also favorably reduce myocardial oxygen consumption in the failing heart because <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor activation decreases LV preload and afterload and, consequently, LV end-diastolic and end-systolic wall stress, respectively.</p>
<p class="indent">Declines in pulmonary arterial pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance mediated through <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor activation occur during administration of dobutamine. This property makes dobutamine a useful inotropic drug to enhance cardiac output in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with preexisting pulmonary hypertension. In contrast to dobutamine, dopamine activates <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors in the pulmonary circulation and venous capacitance vessels, thereby increasing pulmonary arterial pressures and LV preload, respectively. Thus, dobutamine may offer a distinct advantage over dopamine in patients with heart failure accompanied by increased pulmonary vascular resistance and elevated LV filling pressures. Nevertheless, dobutamine-induced pulmonary<a id="page271"></a> vasodilation has the potential to increase transpulmonary shunt and cause relative hypoxemia. Dobutamine does not activate dopaminergic receptors, but the drug may improve renal perfusion as a result of increases in cardiac output. Despite the aforementioned theoretical beneficial cardiovascular effects of the drug, several clinical trials showed that use of dobutamine is linked to an increased incidence of major adverse cardiac events including mortality in patients with heart failure. We no longer recommend the use of dobutamine for inotropic support in this setting as a result.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen194">E. Isoproterenol</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Isoproterenol is a nonselective <em>&#x03B2;</em>-adrenoceptor agonist synthetic catecholamine that exerts almost no activity at <em>&#x03B1;</em>-adrenoceptors. Historically, isoproterenol was used for &#x201C;pharmacological pacing&#x201D; because it increases heart rate in patients with symptomatic bradyarrhythmias or AV conduction block (eg, Mobitz type II second degree block, third degree block). Isoproterenol was also used during cardiac transplantation to increase heart rate and augment myocardial contractility in the denervated donor heart. However, use of the catecholamine for these indications has been largely supplanted by transcutaneous or transvenous pacing, especially in view of the drug&#x2019;s propensity to cause untoward supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Isoproterenol was previously used to treat RV dysfunction associated with severe pulmonary hypertension because the drug reduces pulmonary vascular resistance, but selective inhaled pulmonary vasodilators are more efficacious and cause fewer adverse effects in this setting as well. The clinical utility of isoproterenol is quite limited at present, but the drug&#x2019;s unique pharmacology compared with that of other catecholamines continues to make it worthy of discussion.</p>
<p class="indent">Isoproterenol causes <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor&#x2013;mediated arteriolar vasodilation in skeletal muscle and also dilates the renal and splanchnic circulations, thereby reducing systemic vascular resistance. As a result of these peripheral vascular effects, the drug selectively decreases diastolic and mean arterial pressures while systolic arterial pressure is usually maintained. Isoproterenol causes direct positive chronotropic and dromotropic effects through activation of <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors, but heart rate also increases because baroreceptor reflexes are stimulated in response to declines in arterial pressure. Isoproterenol is a positive inotrope, but cardiac output may not be reliably increased during the drug&#x2019;s administration because pronounced tachycardia prevents optimal LV filling, and <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor&#x2013;mediated venodilation decreases venous return. Dose-related increases in myocardial oxygen consumption occur with isoproterenol accompanied by simultaneous decreases in coronary perfusion pressure and diastolic filling time. These actions may contribute to acute myocardial ischemia or subendocardial necrosis, especially in the presence of coronary artery disease.</p>
