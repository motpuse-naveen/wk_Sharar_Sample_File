<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Nonoperating room anesthesia (NORA)</em></strong> refers to anesthesia services that are provided outside of traditional surgical operating rooms and labor and delivery areas. These locations include, but are not limited to, radiology departments, endoscopy suites, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scanners, cardiac catheterization laboratories (CCL) and electrophysiology laboratories (EPL). NORA cases account for over 30%<sup><a href="ch039-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> of the procedural work of hospitals, and increasingly, patients or the proceduralists require or request anesthesia or sedation to facilitate these procedures. This chapter will discuss the care of patients requiring anesthesia or sedation for procedures in NORA locations. Anesthesia for surgical procedures performed in offices and ambulatory surgery centers is addressed in <a href="ch025.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>, and anesthesia and analgesia provided for labor and delivery is discussed in <a href="ch031.xhtml">Chapter 31</a>.</p>
