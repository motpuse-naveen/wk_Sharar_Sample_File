<p class="nonindent">Hepatocytes are arranged within <strong><em>hepatic sinusoids</em></strong> surrounding a central hepatic vein and are bordered by interlobular <strong><em>portal triads</em></strong> consisting of a biliary duct, hepatic artery, and portal vein (<strong><a href="#ff6-3">Figures 6.3</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#ff6-4">6.4</a></strong>). This functional anatomy results from a complicated embryologic ballet in which the growing organ forms around portal veins, with bile ducts originating out of precursor ductal plates situated on the portal veins. Hepatic sinuses run from the peripheral portal triads to the centrilobular hepatic veins and are lined with fenestrated endothelial cells, featuring intracytoplasmic pores and loose intercellular junctions. In addition to the endothelial cells, other resident cell populations of the sinusoidal wall include <strong><em>Kupffer cells</em></strong> (macrophages), <strong><em>stellate cells</em></strong> (responsible for extracellular matrix production and capable of contractile function to regulate sinusoidal blood flow), and <strong><em>pit cells</em></strong> (lymphocytes). The space separating the sinusoids from hepatocyte bars is known as the <strong><em>perisinusoidal<a id="page116"></a> space of Disse</em></strong>, and it contains extracellular matrix generated by stellate cells, Kupffer cells, and dendritic cells. These latter two cell types are involved in microbial and antigen host defense and contribute to the significant immune function of the liver as well as to the fibrosis observed with hepatic cirrhosis. (See <strong><a href="ch006-sec03.xhtml#tt6-1">Table 6.1</a></strong>.)</p>
