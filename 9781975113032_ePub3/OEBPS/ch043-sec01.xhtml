<h5 class="h5" id="sen752">A. Cystoscopy and Ureteroscopy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Both cystoscopy and ureteroscopy are considered endoscopic procedures. Cystoscopy allows the surgeon to visualize and treat the lower urinary tract including the urethra and bladder while ureteroscopy allows for examination and treatment of the upper urinary tract including the ureters and kidneys. Cystoscopy is generally less stimulating than ureteroscopy and as such affords more options for anesthesia including local, conscious sedation, regional or general techniques. The choice of anesthetic is governed both by patient related (eg, highly anxious or severe pulmonary disease) and procedural factors (eg, invasiveness and duration). Ureteroscopy, on the other hand, often requires general or regional anesthesia as exploration into the ureters and kidney is generally more stimulating.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen753">B. Resection of Bladder Tumors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Bladder cancer is the sixth most common malignancy in the United States and second most common urologic malignancy. Greater than 90% of these cancers are either urothelial or transitional cell carcinoma.<sup><a href="ch043-sec06.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> Bladder cancer typically presents as painless hematuria. Initial evaluation consists of cystoscopy and renal function tests +/&#x2212; bladder cytology depending on risk factors and suspicion. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor or TURBT is performed for those with abnormal cytology. TURBT can be performed under either regional or general anesthesia. It should be noted that for an inferolaterally located bladder tumor, obturator nerve stimulation may occur with regional anesthesia. The obturator nerve is derived from L3/L4 with some contribution from L2. Surgical stimulation of the obturator nerve can result in potential rapid adductor muscle contraction resulting in injury to the surgeon or bladder perforation, a well-known risk of this procedure. This mechanical stimulation occurs distal to the site of local anesthetic blockade during spinal anesthesia. For this reason, general anesthesia with muscle relaxation<a id="page898"></a> or regional anesthesia with supplemental direct obturator nerve blockade is preferred. In an awake patient with regional anesthesia, bladder perforation can be signaled by sudden intense abdominal pain as well as nausea, vomiting, sweating, and abdominal rigidity. If extravasation of the irrigating fluid is suspected, the operation should be stopped as soon as possible as the accumulation of large amounts of irrigating fluid in the intraperitoneal cavity can be life-threatening. Most of these cases will require an open laparotomy in order to repair the bladder perforation and drain the collection. Small perforations, however, usually do not cause significant hemodynamic changes and can be managed conservatively with drains and diuretics.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen754">C. Resection of the Prostate</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common diseases in aging men with a prevalence between 8% and 80% between the ages of 40 and 90&#x00A0;years. It can lead to lower urinary tract symptoms which can cause urinary retention and necessitates the need for surgical therapy in a large number of aging men. Symptomatic BPH can be treated medically or surgically. The most common surgical procedure performed is a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in which pieces of prostatic tissue that protrude into the urethra and disrupt the flow of urine are removed by a resectoscope to create patency. Continuous irrigation of the bladder and urethra provides a visible field for the surgeon and allows all dissected tissue and blood to be removed.<sup><a href="ch043-sec06.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup> The prostatic capsule is preserved in these cases.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Transurethral Resection of the Prostate</strong></p>
<h6 class="h6">1. Transurethral Resection of the Prostate</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Classic monopolar TURP procedures can result in the absorption of large volumes (&#x003E;2000&#x00A0;mL) of irrigating solution into the plexus of venous sinuses. This excessive fluid absorption results in a constellation of symptoms known as TURP syndrome. Symptoms may include headaches, confusion, nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, anxiety, arrhythmias, hyper-/hypotension, and seizures.<sup><a href="ch043-sec06.xhtml#bib3">3</a>,<a href="ch043-sec06.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> The symptoms that arise depend on the type of irrigating fluid, as shown in <strong><a href="#tt43-1">Table 43.1</a></strong>. Given the risk of absorption, the ideal irrigating fluid should be isotonic, nonhemolytic, nontoxic when absorbed, nonelectrolytic, not metabolized, clear, and rapidly excreted. Most irrigation solutions, however, are hypo-osmolar and acidic. Common solutions like normal saline and lactated Ringer solution are not routinely used, because although isotonic, they contain electrolytes which can conduct electrical current when a monopolar electrical resectoscope is used. Given that most fluids used are hypo-osmolar, they can cause a dilutional hyponatremia resulting in severe neurological symptoms if sodium values fall below 120&#x00A0;mEq/L. Acute severe hyponatremia can be fatal, so early recognition and treatment, including stopping the offending irrigant is key; see <strong><a href="#tt43-2">Table 43.2</a></strong> for signs and symptoms and <strong><a href="#tt43-3">Table 43.3</a></strong> for a summary of treatments.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Most irrigating solutions are hypo-osmolar and acidic. Transient blindness is associated with glycine irrigation, hyperglycemia is associated with sorbitol, and volume overload is associated with the use of mannitol.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The amount of fluid absorbed is dependent on the number and size of venous sinuses opened, duration of surgery, experience of the surgeon, and hydrostatic pressure (determined by height above the surgical table of the irrigation solution bag). During resection, irrigating fluid is absorbed at a rate of 10 to 30&#x00A0;mL/min with the majority occurring in the first 30 minutes of the procedure. The volume of fluid absorbed can be estimated with the following formula:</p>

<p class="indent">To mitigate absorption, it is recommended that resections conclude in less than an hour, and limits are placed on irrigating solution bag height to curtail hydrostatic pressure.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Absorption of large volumes of irrigating solution leads to intravascular volume overload, hyponatremia, and hypo-osmolality.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">2. Bleeding and Coagulopathy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Factors affecting blood loss during TURP include duration of surgery, size and vascularity of the prostate, the number of venous sinuses opened during the resection, and presence of infection. Given that blood is mixed with the irrigation fluid, blood loss can be challenging to asses and may necessitate serial hematocrit values and intravascular volume assessment to determine if transfusion is necessary. Significant bleeding after TURP is rare and occurs in less than 1% of cases. Most cases of abnormal bleeding after TURP are likely a result of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Absorption of the irrigating fluid during TURP is directly related to the number and size of opened venous sinuses, duration of resection, and the height of the bag of irrigating solution above the surgical table.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">3. Bladder Perforation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Bladder perforation during TURP has an incidence of approximately 1%. Signs and symptoms of perforation vary depending on the consciousness of the patient and the dermatomal level of the regional anesthetic. An awake patient under regional anesthesia may experience nausea, vomiting, sweating, and upper or lower abdominal pain depending on location of perforation. Patients may also have referred pain to the shoulder. Under general anesthesia, sudden hyper- or hypotension may occur along with bradycardia.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy is the likely etiology of abnormal bleeding after TURP.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">4. Transient Bacteremia and Septicemia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Bacteremia as a result of TURP is fairly common, usually asymptomatic and easily treated with commonly used antibiotic combinations that are effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Higher rates of bacteremia are associated with recent antibiotic use and presence of an indwelling urinary catheter. Septicemia may occur in some of these patients (approximately 7%), presenting as chills, fever, and tachycardia and can quickly worsen to include bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse. Mortality rates from septicemia range from 25% to 75% and therefore should be aggressively treated with antibiotics and critical care support.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The urologist may suspect perforation by noting the irregular return of irrigating fluid.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">5. Hypothermia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">There are many causes of hypothermia during surgery such as circulatory redistribution following general anesthesia and evaporative heat loss from an open surgical field. Heat loss during TURP may also result from irrigation and absorption of room temperature irrigating fluid. Warmed fluids have been shown to minimize this risk.</p>
<h6 class="h6">6. Positioning Complications</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Injury to common peroneal, sciatic, and femoral nerves can occur as a result of improper padding or positioning. TURP is most commonly performed in the lithotomy position with slight Trendelenburg.</p>
<h6 class="h6">7. Anesthetic Techniques</h6>
<p class="nonindent">TURP can be performed under general or regional anesthesia (spinal or epidural). Classically, regional has been the technique of choice as patients can remain awake allowing for detection of early signs of bladder perforation or<a id="page901"></a> TURP syndrome. For adequate coverage of bladder distention and sacral segments, spinal anesthesia to a T10 sensory level is preferred. Epidural anesthesia may inadequately block discomfort in the sacral segments. General anesthesia with either an endotracheal tube or a supraglottic airway is a very reasonable alternative.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Regional anesthesia has been the anesthetic technique of choice for TURP as the conscious patient can alert the clinicians to the early signs of TURP syndrome or bladder perforation.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">8. Morbidity and Mortality After TURP</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Most complications after TURP are minor, but more serious complications including severe blood loss, capsule perforations, pulmonary thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, urosepsis, TURP syndrome, and even death have been reported in the literature. Complications are increased unsurprisingly, with increased patient age, comorbidities, and longer surgical times.</p>
<h6 class="h6">9. The Future of TURP</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Less invasive surgical treatments have evolved over time and provide options for patients at higher risk of complications following the traditional TURP including the elderly and those with significant comorbidities. Many patients who would have endured classic monopolar TURP are currently treated with bipolar TURP, a common technique characterized by a much lower incidence of complications. Other less invasive options include balloon dilatation, prostatic stents, transurethral incision of the prostate, and laser prostatectomy. These procedures may be done on an outpatient basis, as they are associated with minimal blood loss and less risk of TURP syndrome.<sup><a href="ch043-sec06.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup></p>
