<p class="nonindent">Pain is a highly subjective experience and affects many aspects of life. As such, the evaluation of the patient in pain relies primarily on patient-reported information and should include assessment of multiple domains. Because pain is dynamic, it should be reassessed regularly and adjustments to therapy made as appropriate. The location of the pain and where it radiates, if at all, are important. In the postoperative setting, it is still necessary to ask where the pain is located rather than presume the pain is incisional. Patients may have additional pain related to preexisting conditions, positioning or retraction during surgery, and immobility. The onset and temporal pattern as well as exacerbating and ameliorating factors are established. The quality of the pain can help indicate its origin and possible treatment options&#x2014;sharp incisional pain may respond well to opioids and nerve blocks, but shooting neuropathic pain may respond to an antiepileptic agent.</p>
<p class="indent">The intensity of pain should be assessed in multiple contexts. The baseline level of pain is the pain that exists at all times, while breakthrough pain escalates beyond the background intensity. Multiple tools exist to aid in the assessment of pain intensity, all of which are arbitrary, are subjective, and have a high degree of variability between patients. Despite these flaws, they are useful to determine trends in pain control. The numerical rating scale is most commonly used, which asks patients to rate their pain from 0, no pain, to 10, worst pain imaginable. For young children or patients with cognitive impairments, the facial grimace scale allows for a more descriptive approach (<strong><a href="#ff38-4">Figure 38.4</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">Because pain impacts many activities, it is important to investigate the patient&#x2019;s functional status including the ability to eat, sleep, ambulate, work, and perform one&#x2019;s activities of daily living. Any side effects from pain therapy should be thoroughly discussed as well. Physical examination is focused on possible etiologies of pain and should include a thorough neurologic and musculoskeletal examination.</p>
