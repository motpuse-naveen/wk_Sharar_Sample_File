<p class="nonindent">Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is an unfortunate but common complaint from patients emerging from anesthesia. PONV can cause significant distress, can negatively impact a patient&#x2019;s postoperative recovery, and<a id="page844"></a> is often more poorly tolerated than postoperative pain. In addition, retching caused by PONV can put strain on surgical incision sites and, in worse-case scenarios, can lead to abdominal wound dehiscence or development of a neck hematoma around a neck incision.</p>

<p class="indent">The best treatment strategy is prevention with multi-modal antiemetics administered prior to emergence in high-risk patients. Common antiemetic medications include antiserotonergics (ondansetron), antidopaminergics (metoclopramide/haloperidol), antimuscarinics (scopolamine), antihistamines (diphenhydramine), antipsychotics (phenothiazines such as prochlorperazine and promethazine), and dexamethasone. Benzodiazepines and propofol may also have antiemetic properties. Any of the above medications may be used to treat PONV in the PACU, once serious causes of PONV such as hypotension, hypoglycemia, and raised ICP have been ruled out, although it is important to keep the side effect profiles of each in mind. For example, many antiemetics such as ondansetron, metoclopramide, haloperidol, and the phenothiazines can cause QTc prolongation and should be avoided in those patients with a prolonged QTc or those who are already taking QTc prolonging drugs; antidopaminergic<a id="page845"></a> agents can cause extrapyramidal side effects and should be avoided or used with caution in the elderly and those with Parkinson disease; dexamethasone can lead to hyperglycemia in diabetic patients; benzodiazepines and scopolamine can lead to confusion and should be avoided in the elderly.</p>
