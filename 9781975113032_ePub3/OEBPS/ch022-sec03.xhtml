<h5 class="h5" id="sen342">A. Upper Extremity Neuropathies</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>1. Ulnar Neuropathy</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Ulnar neuropathy is the most common perioperative peripheral neuropathy (<strong><a href="#tt22-1">Table 22.1</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch022-sec06.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup> There are a number of factors that may be associated with ulnar neuropathy, including direct extrinsic nerve compression (often on the medial aspect of the elbow), intrinsic nerve compression (associated with prolonged elbow flexion), and inflammation. Key points of interest are as follows:</p>
<ul class="u_bullb"><li><span><strong><em>Timing of postoperative symptoms:</em></strong> Most patients experience their first symptoms at least 24 hours postoperatively. This suggests that the mechanism of acute injury occurs primarily outside the operating room. Importantly, medical patients also develop ulnar neuropathies during hospitalization.</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Impact of elbow flexion:</em></strong> The ulnar nerve is the only major peripheral nerve in the body that always passes on the extensor side of a joint, in this case, the elbow. All other major peripheral nerves primarily pass on the flexion side of joints (eg, median and femoral nerves). This anatomic difference may contribute to the relatively higher rate of perioperative injury involving the ulnar nerve. In general, peripheral nerves begin to lose function and develop foci of ischemia when they are stretched &#x003E;5% of their resting lengths. Elbow flexion, particularly &#x003E;90&#x00B0;, stretches the ulnar nerve. Prolonged elbow flexion and stretch of the ulnar nerve can result in ischemia sufficient to cause symptoms in awake patients.</span></li></ul>
<div class="figureu5" id="ff22-2"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff22-2.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="ucaption"><span class="u_fignum">Figure&#160;22.2</span> Effect of tissue stretch and compression on nerve vasa nervosum. This example shows potential ulnar nerve injury with elbow flexion. A, Extended elbow and relaxed ulnar nerve, noting patent perforating arterioles and venules. B, Flexed elbow, noting that stretch of the penetrating arterioles and venules from elongation of the ulnar nerve or compression by the cubital tunnel retinaculum can lead to vessel kinking and result in reduced arteriole blood flow from outside to inside the nerve (causing direct ischemia) and venous congestion from reduced venule outflow as vessel exits the nerve (leading to indirect ischemia). Prolonged ischemia can lead to nerve injury.</figcaption></figure></div>
<ul class="u_bullb"><li><span><strong><em>Anatomy and intrinsic pressure:</em></strong> Prolonged elbow flexion of &#x003E;90&#x00B0; increases intrinsic pressure on the nerve and may be as important an etiologic factor as prolonged extrinsic pressure.<sup><a href="ch022-sec06.xhtml#bib6">6</a>,<a href="ch022-sec06.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup> The ulnar nerve passes behind the medial epicondyle and then runs under the aponeurosis that holds the two muscle bodies of the flexor carpi ulnaris together. The proximal edge of this aponeurosis is sufficiently thick, especially in men, to be separately named the cubital tunnel retinaculum. This retinaculum stretches from the medial epicondyle to the olecranon. Flexion of the elbow stretches the retinaculum and generates high pressures intrinsically on the nerve as it passes underneath (<strong><a href="#ff22-3">Figures 22.3</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#ff22-4">22.4</a></strong>).</span></li></ul>

It is commonly called the cubital tunnel retinaculum. B, Viewed from behind, the cubital tunnel retinaculum intrinsically compresses the ulnar nerve when the elbow is progressively flexed beyond 90&#x00B0; and the distance between the olecranon and the medial epicondyle increases.</figcaption></figure></div>
<ul class="u_bullb"><li><span><strong><em>Forearm supination and ulnar neuropathy:</em></strong> Supination of the forearm and hand does not, by itself, reduce the risk of ulnar neuropathy. The action of forearm supination occurs distal to the elbow. Supination is typically used when positioning arms on arm boards or at the patient&#x2019;s sides because of the impact it has on humerus rotation. That is, with forearm supination there will be external rotation of the humerus. It is this external rotation of the humerus that lifts the medical aspect of the elbow, including the ulnar nerve, from directly resting on the table or arm board surface. This rotation helps reduce extrinsic pressure on the ulnar nerve.</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Outcomes of ulnar neuropathy:</em></strong> Forty percent of sensory-only ulnar neuropathies resolve within 5&#x00A0;days; 80% resolve within 6&#x00A0;months. Few combined sensory and motor ulnar neuropathies resolve within 5&#x00A0;days, only 20% resolve within 6&#x00A0;months, and most result in permanent motor dysfunction and pain. The motor fibers in the ulnar nerve are primarily located in its middle. Injury at this depth of the nerve is likely associated with a more significant ischemic or pressure-related insult.</span></li></ul>

<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Ulnar neuropathy with sensory-only symptoms has a good prognosis. Most cases resolve spontaneously within a few days or months.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">2. Median Neuropathies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Median neuropathies primarily occur in men between the ages of 20 and 40&#x00A0;years. These men often have large biceps and reduced flexibility (eg, as in the case of weightlifters) which compromise complete extension at the elbow. This limitation in range of motion results in shortening of the median nerve over time. Median neuropathies typically involve motor dysfunction and do not resolve readily. In fact, up to 80% of median neuropathies with motor dysfunction are sustained 2&#x00A0;years after initial onset. Key points of interest are as follows:</p>
<ul class="u_bullb"><li><span><strong><em>Stretch:</em></strong> As mentioned previously, nerves become ischemic when stretched &#x003E;5% of their resting length. This amount of stretch tends to kink penetrating arterioles and exiting venules, both of which decrease perfusion pressure.</span></li>
<li><span><a id="page468"></a><strong><em>Arm support:</em></strong> Full extension at the elbow stretches chronically contracted median nerves and promotes ischemia. Thus, it is important that the forearm and hand be supported to prevent full extension, especially in men who have large, bulky biceps and who cannot fully extend their elbows because of a lack of flexibility.</span></li></ul>
<div class="figureu5" id="ff22-4"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff22-4.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="ucaption"><span class="u_fignum">Figure&#160;22.4</span> Pressure within the cubital reticulum at the elbow escalates once the angle of elbow flexion reaches and exceeds 90&#x00B0;.

<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Muscular men with large biceps are susceptible to median nerve injury if the arm is fully extended during surgery.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">3. Radial Neuropathies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Radial neuropathies occur more often than median neuropathies. The radial nerve appears to be injured by direct compression. The important factor appears to be compression of the nerve in the mid-humerus region, where it wraps posteriorly around the bone (<strong><a href="#ff22-5">Figure 22.5</a></strong>). Radial neuropathies tend to have a better prognosis than ulnar or median neuropathies. Approximately half get better within 6&#x00A0;months, and 70% appear to resolve completely within 2&#x00A0;years. Key points of interest are as follows:</p>
<ul class="u_bullb"><li><span><strong><em>Surgical retractors:</em></strong> A case series reported several radial neuropathies associated with compression of the radial nerve by the vertical bars of upper abdominal retractor holders. These vertical support bars reportedly impinged the arms (<strong><a href="#ff22-5">Figure 22.5A</a></strong>).</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Lateral positions:</em></strong> The radial nerve may be impinged by overhead arm boards when they protrude into the mid-humerus soft tissue (<strong><a href="#ff22-5">Figure 22.5D</a></strong>).</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>An unsupported arm:</em></strong> Compression of the radial nerve by the weight of the humerus may occur when a previously supported arm (either at the patient&#x2019;s side or on an arm board) slips and loses support particularly where vulnerable in the mid-humeral region. (<strong><a href="#ff22-5">Figure 22.5E</a></strong>).</span></li></ul>
<h6 class="h6">4. Brachial Plexopathies</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Brachial plexopathies occur most often in patients undergoing sternotomy, particularly with internal mammary artery mobilization. This finding is presumed to be associated with excessive concentric retraction on the chest wall and compression or stretch of the plexus between the clavicle and rib cage. <a id="page469"></a><a id="page470"></a><a id="page471"></a>With the exception of sternotomy surgeries, brachial plexus injury is more common in surgeries performed in the prone or lateral position rather than the supine position. Key points of interest are as follows:</p>
<div class="figureu5" id="ff22-5"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff22-5.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="ucaption"><span class="u_fignum">Figure&#160;22.5</span> The anatomy of the radial nerve is shown in the upper left corner, illustrating how it wraps around the mid-humerus. Reported mechanisms of perioperative injury include (A) compression by surgical retractor support bar; (B) direct needle trauma at the wrist; (C) compressive tourniquet effect by a draw sheet at the wrist; (D) impingement by an overhead arm board; and (E) compression in the mid-humerus level as the arm supports much of the weight of the upper extremity.</figcaption></figure></div>
<div class="figureu5" id="ff22-6"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff22-6.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="ucaption"><span class="u_fignum">Figure&#160;22.6</span> A, The neurovascular bundle to the upper extremity passes on the flexion side of the shoulder joint when the arm is at the side or abducted &#x003C;90&#x00B0;. B, Abduction of the arm beyond 90&#x00B0; transitions the neurovascular bundle to where it now lies on the extension side of the shoulder joint. Progressive abduction &#x003E;90&#x00B0; increases stretch on the nerves at the shoulder joint.</figcaption></figure></div>
<ul class="u_bullb"><li><span><strong><em>Brachial plexus entrapment:</em></strong> The brachial plexus can become entrapped between the clavicle and the rib cage. Special attention should be given to altering positions that might exacerbate this potential problem.</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Prone positioning:</em></strong> In surgeries requiring the prone position, it is prudent to tuck the arms at the side if possible, as many patients have somatosensory-evoked potential changes when their arms are abducted (eg, a &#x201C;surrender&#x201D; position).</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Anatomy of shoulder abduction:</em></strong> Abduction of the shoulder &#x003E;90&#x00B0; places the distal plexus on the extensor side of the joint and potentially stretches the plexus (<strong><a href="#ff22-6">Figure 22.6</a></strong>). Therefore, it is best to avoid abduction &#x003E;90&#x00B0;, especially for extended periods.</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen343">B. Lower Extremity Neuropathies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although common peroneal/fibular, and sciatic neuropathies have the most impact on ambulation, the most common perioperative neuropathies in the lower extremities involve the obturator and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves (<strong><a href="#tt22-2">Table 22.2</a></strong>). Key points of interest are as follows:</p>
<ul class="u_bullb"><li><span><strong><em>Obturator neuropathy:</em></strong> Hip abduction &#x003E;30&#x00B0; results in significant strain on the obturator nerve.<sup><a href="ch022-sec06.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup> The nerve passes through the pelvis and out the obturator foramen. With hip abduction, the superior and lateral rim of the foramen serves as a fulcrum (<strong><a href="#ff22-7">Figure 22.7</a></strong>). <a id="page472"></a><a id="page473"></a>The nerve stretches along its full length and is also compressed at this fulcrum point. Thus, excessive hip abduction should be avoided. With obturator neuropathy, motor dysfunction is common. Although it is usually not painful, it can be crippling. Approximately 50% of patients who have motor dysfunction in the perioperative period will continue to have it 2&#x00A0;years later.</span></li></ul>

B, Hip flexion, especially when &#x003E;90&#x00B0;, leads to stretch of the inguinal ligament as the ilium is displaced laterally. This stretch causes the intraligament pressure to increase and compresses the nerve fibers as they pass through the ligament.</figcaption></figure></div>
<ul class="u_bullb"><li><span><strong><em>Lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy:</em></strong> Prolonged hip flexion &#x003E;90&#x00B0; increases ischemia on fibers of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. One-third of this nerve&#x2019;s fibers pass through the inguinal ligament as they enter the thigh (<strong><a href="#ff22-8">Figure 22.8</a></strong>). Hip flexion &#x003E;90&#x00B0; results in lateral displacement of the anterior superior iliac spine and stretch of the inguinal ligament. The penetrating nerve fibers are compressed by this stretch and, with time, become ischemic and dysfunctional. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve carries only sensory fibers, so there is no motor disability when it is injured. However, patients with this perioperative neuropathy can have disabling pain and dysesthesias of the lateral thigh.

Leg positioners, which include a range of styles (&#x201C;candy cane,&#x201D; &#x201C;crutch,&#x201D; and &#x201C;stirrups&#x201D;) can impinge on the nerve as it wraps around the head of the fibula.
