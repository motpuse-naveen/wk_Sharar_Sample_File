<h5 class="h5" id="sen305">A. Preoxygenation</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Preoxygenation</em></strong> (also termed <strong><em>denitrogenation</em></strong>) should be practiced in all cases when time allows. Under ideal conditions, a healthy patient breathing room air (fraction of inspired oxygen [<span class="usmall">FIO</span><sub>2</sub>]&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;0.21) will experience oxyhemoglobin desaturation to a level of &#x003C;90% after approximately 1 to 2 minutes of apnea. In the same patient, several minutes of preoxygenation with 100% oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) via a tight-fitting facemask may support &#x2265;8 minutes of apnea before desaturation occurs. Patients with pulmonary disease, obesity, or conditions affecting metabolism frequently evidence desaturation <a id="page425"></a>sooner, owing to increased O<sub>2</sub> extraction, decreased functional residual capacity, or right-to-left transpulmonary shunting. The most common reason for suboptimal preoxygenation is a loose-fitting mask, which allows entrainment of room air.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen306">B. Facemask Ventilation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The anesthesia facemask is gently held on the patient&#x2019;s face with the thumb and first finger of the left hand, leaving the right hand free for other tasks. Air leak around the edges of the mask can be prevented by gentle downward pressure. A two-handed grip or an elastic &#x201C;mask strap&#x201D; may be used to complement the left-hand grip.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen307">C. Patient Positioning</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Appropriate positioning of the patient is paramount for delivering <strong><em>positive pressure ventilation</em></strong> via facemask. With the patient supine, &#x201C;ramped,&#x201D; or in reverse Trendelenburg position, the neck is flexed by 35&#x00B0; and the head extended by 15&#x00B0;. This <strong><em>sniffing position</em></strong> improves mask ventilation by anteriorizing the base of the tongue and the epiglottis.</p>
<a id="page426"></a>
<p class="indent">Dentures left in place may improve the mask seal for an edentulous patient. The advantage of this must be weighed against the risk of denture displacement or damage. Dentures should be removed after the airway is secured.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen308">D. Difficult Mask Ventilation</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><a href="#tt20-6">Table 20.6</a></strong> describes six independent clinical predictors for difficult mask ventilation.<sup><a href="#bib2">2</a>,<a href="#bib3">3</a></sup> Under normal conditions, no more than 20 to 25&#x00A0;cm water (H<sub>2</sub>O) pressure in the anesthesia circuit (created by squeezing the reservoir bag) is needed to inflate the lungs. If more pressure is required to produce adequate lung inflation, the anesthesiologist should reevaluate the situation. This evaluation includes adjusting the mask fit, seeking aid with the mask hold, or considering adjuncts such as oral and nasal airways. Oral and nasal airways can bypass obstruction by creating an artificial passage through the pharynx and hypopharynx. Nasal airways are less likely to stimulate cough, gag, or vomiting in the lightly anesthetized patient but more likely to cause epistaxis, thus typically avoided in patients at high risk for nasal bleeding.</p>
<p class="indent">Obstruction to mask ventilation may be caused by <strong><em>laryngospasm,</em></strong> a local reflex closure of the vocal folds. Laryngospasm may be triggered by a foreign<a id="page427"></a> body (eg, oral or nasal airway), saliva, blood, or vomitus touching the glottis. It may also result from pain or visceral stimulation. Management of laryngospasm consists of removing the offending stimulus (if identified), administering oxygen with continuous positive airway pressure, deepening the plane of the anesthesia and, if other maneuvers are unsuccessful, using a rapid-acting muscle relaxant.<sup><a href="#bib4">4</a></sup></p>

<p class="nonindent">Airway devices that isolate the airway above the vocal cords are referred to as <strong><em>supraglottic airways</em></strong> (SGAs). These devices may be advantageous in patients with reactive airway disease as they lead to reversible bronchospasm than ETTs. A wide variety of SGA devices are currently available. The original SGA, the laryngeal mask airway (LMA), is composed of a perilaryngeal mask and an airway barrel. The mask has an inflatable cuff, which fills the hypopharyngeal space, creating a seal that allows positive pressure ventilation with up to 20&#x00A0;cmH<sub>2</sub>O pressure. The following description of the LMA can be applied to all commercially available SGAs, although it should be noted that the iGel does not have an inflatable cuff.</p>

<p class="indent">The manufacturer recommends that the clinician choose the largest size LMA that fits comfortably within the oral cavity. For use, the LMA mask is completely deflated. The patient&#x2019;s neck is extended and the superior surface of the mask is placed against the hard palate. Force is applied by the index finger in an upward direction toward the top of the patient&#x2019;s head, and the mask is allowed to follow the palate into the pharynx and hypopharynx. Next, the LMA is inflated to the minimum pressure that allows ventilation to 20&#x00A0;cmH<sub>2</sub>O without an air leak. The intracuff pressure should remain below 44&#x00A0;mm Hg (60&#x00A0;cmH<sub>2</sub>O) and should be periodically monitored, especially if nitrous oxide is used.<sup><a href="#bib5">5</a></sup> When an adequate seal cannot be obtained with 60&#x00A0;cmH<sub>2</sub>O cuff pressure, the LMA&#x2019;s positioning or sizing should be reevaluated. Light anesthesia and laryngospasm also may contribute to poor seal.</p>
<p class="indent">Positive pressure ventilation can be used safely with the LMA.<sup><a href="#bib6">6</a></sup> There is no difference in gastric inflation with positive pressure ventilation (&#x003C;17&#x00A0;cmH<sub>2</sub>O) when comparing the LMA and ETT.<sup><a href="#bib7">7</a></sup> With the classic LMA, tidal volumes should be limited to 8&#x00A0;mL/kg and airway pressure to 20&#x00A0;cmH<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<p class="indent">If at any time gastric contents are noted in the LMA barrel, the LMA should be left in place. The patient is placed in a Trendelenburg position, 100% oxygen is administered, and the LMA barrel is suctioned.</p>
<h6 class="h6">SGA Removal</h6>
<p class="nonindent">SGAs should be removed either when the patient is deeply anesthetized or after protective reflexes have returned and the patient is able to open his or her mouth on command. Many clinicians remove the LMA fully inflated so that it acts as a &#x201C;scoop&#x201D; for secretions above the mask, bringing them out of the airway.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Complications of SGA Use</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Apart from gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration, reported complications include laryngospasm, coughing, gagging, and other events characteristic of airway manipulation. The incidence of SGA-induced postoperative sore throat varies from 4% to 50% and is highly dependent on the study methods. No single device shows a consistently lower rate of dysphagia, although all appear to be better than tracheal intubation in this regard.<sup><a href="#bib9">9</a></sup> Rare reports exist of nerve injury associated with SGA use.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Cough Reflex</strong></p>
<h6 class="h6">Second-Generation SGAs</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many modern SGAs now incorporate a second lumen which, when properly placed, sits within the upper esophageal opening. Second-generation SGAs tend to allow higher airway positive pressure than first-generation SGAs (&#x2265;40&#x00A0;cmH<sub>2</sub>O), as well as passive (regurgitation) and active (gastric tube insertion) emptying of the stomach.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen310">F. Tracheal Intubation</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Direct Laryngoscopy</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">The ultimate goal of DL is to produce a direct line of sight from the operator&#x2019;s eye to the glottic opening. This view of the larynx is generally described in terms of the Cormack-Lehane grade (grades 1-4), which correlate with increasingly difficult intubation (<strong><a href="#ff20-4">Figure 20.4</a></strong>). No single preoperative measure is adequate to predict difficulty of DL. Unanticipated failure of DL is primarily a problem of tongue displacement, and lingual tonsil hyperplasia is the most common cause of unanticipated difficult DL (<strong><a href="#ff20-5">Figure 20.5</a></strong>).</p>

<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Application of the Miller blade stimulates the vagus cranial nerve (X), while the Macintosh blade stimulates the glossopharyngeal cranial nerve (IX). Thus, there is a greater risk of bradycardia with the Miller blade.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Direct Laryngoscope Blades</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Two blades, each with a unique manner of application, are in common use. The <strong><em>Macintosh</em></strong> (curved) <strong><em>blade</em></strong> is used to displace the epiglottis out of the line of sight by placement in the vallecula and tensing of the glossoepiglottic ligament. The <strong><em>Miller</em></strong> (straight) <strong><em>blade</em></strong> reveals the glottis by compressing the epiglottis against the base of the tongue (<strong><a href="#ff20-6">Figure 20.6</a></strong>). Both blades include a flange along the left side of their length, which is used to sweep the tongue to the left. As a generalization, the Macintosh blade is considered advantageous when there is little room to pass an ETT (eg, small mouth). The Miller blade is considered superior in the patient who has a small mandibular space, large incisors, or a large epiglottis.</p>
<p class="indent">With either blade, the laryngoscopist must strive to avoid rotating the laryngoscope handle in a cephalad direction, bringing the blade against the upper<a id="page431"></a> incisors. Extending either blade style too deeply can bring the tip of the blade to rest under the larynx itself, so that forward pressure lifts the airway from view. If a satisfactory laryngeal view is not achieved, the BURP maneuver may be applied. In this maneuver, the larynx is displaced (B) backward, (U) upward, and (R) to the right, using pressure (P) over the cricoid cartilage.<sup><a href="#bib10">10</a></sup></p>

<p class="indent">Although a variety of methods can be used to verify that the tracheal tube has been successfully placed, the detection of sustained end-tidal carbon dioxide is the only method considered definitive and should be sought in all cases. Other indicators of endotracheal placement include humidity in the tracheal tube, chest rise and fall, full return of the tidal volume during expiration, and auscultation of breath sounds over the lungs but not the stomach.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Airway Bougies</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Airway bougies</em></strong> (or introducers) are low-cost adjuncts that can aid with intubation when a poor laryngeal view (Cormack-Lehane grade 3 or 4) is obtained. These semiflexible stylets can be blindly manipulated under the epiglottis and into the trachea. The operator often feels &#x201C;clicks&#x201D; as the bougies&#x2019; tip passes over the tracheal rings. An ETT is then &#x201C;threaded&#x201D; over the bougie and into the trachea.</p>
<a id="page433"></a>
<h6 class="h6">Optical Stylets</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Optical stylets incorporate both optical and light source elements into a single styletlike stainless steel shaft.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Videolaryngoscopy</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Videolaryngoscopy (VL)</em></strong> mimics the actions of a traditional laryngoscope but, by placing an imaging device toward the distal end of a laryngoscope blade, removes the need for a direct line of sight to the glottis. The first widely available videolaryngoscope was the Glidescope, which has a 60-degree angulated blade. The &#x201C;channel configuration&#x201D; VLs incorporate a semicircular channel alongside the optical elements. These scopes have an anatomic shape with a near right angle between the handle-oral segment and the pharyngeal-hypopharyngeal segment. The channels are aligned with the laryngoscopic view so that, once the glottis is visualized, a preloaded, lubricated tube is advanced through the channel.</p>
<p class="indent">The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Difficult Airway Taskforce recommends that a videolaryngoscope be available as a first attempt or rescue device for all patients being intubated.<sup><a href="#bib11">11</a></sup> VL improves the ability to visualize the larynx, and intubation success approaches 97% to 98%. An added benefit is decreased cervical motion when compared with DL, which appears to be more pronounced with the channeled devices.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">As many as 96% of failed attempts at intubation with direct laryngoscopy can be rescued with a videolaryngoscope.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen311">G. Control of Gastric Contents</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Risk of Aspiration</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Preventing pulmonary <strong><em>aspiration</em></strong> of gastric contents is a primary concern during airway management. Altered physiologic states (eg, pregnancy and diabetes mellitus) and gastrointestinal pathology (eg, bowel obstruction and peritonitis) adversely affect the rate of gastric emptying, thereby increasing aspiration risk. The ASA recommends a fasting period of 4 hours for breast milk and 6 hours for nonhuman milk, infant formula, and a light solid meal. Clear liquids can be administered up to 2 hours prior to anesthesia without increased risk for regurgitation and aspiration.<sup><a href="#bib12">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Reduction of gastric acidity can be achieved with the aid of H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors, which also reduce gastric volume.<sup><a href="#bib12">12</a></sup> Sodium citrate oral solution increases gastric pH (more alkaline) and is best administered within 1 hour preoperatively.<sup><a href="#bib13">13</a></sup> A nasogastric tube can be used to reduce gastric volume prior to anesthesia in patients at high risk of regurgitation.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Rapid-Sequence Induction</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Rapid-sequence induction (RSI)</em></strong> is indicated when aspiration of gastric contents poses a significant risk. The goal of RSI is to gain control of the airway in the shortest amount of time after the ablation of protective airway reflexes with the induction of anesthesia. In the RSI technique, an intravenous anesthetic induction agent is administered and immediately followed by a rapidly acting neuromuscular blocking drug. Laryngoscopy and intubation are performed as soon as muscle relaxation is confirmed. <strong><em>Cricoid pressure may be</em></strong> employed (Sellick maneuver), which entails the downward displacement of the cricoid cartilage against the vertebral bodies in an attempt to ablate the <a id="page434"></a>esophageal lumen. The effectiveness of cricoid pressure is in question and it may make laryngoscopy more difficult. Historically, face mask ventilation is not undertaken prior to intubation, but little evidence supports this. Many practicing clinicians have abandoned these latter two practices for lack of evidence-based support.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Cricoid Pressure</strong></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen312">H. Intubating SGAs</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A variety of SGAs specifically designed to facilitate intubation are available. These SGAs are inserted using a similar technique to the classic LMA. Once seated, the mask is inflated and ventilation is attempted. After adequate ventilation is achieved, an ETT is advanced through the barrel of the SGA. Although the Fastrach LMA excels at blind intubation, a fiberscope should be used with the other varieties. Once successful intubation is confirmed, an intubating SGA may be removed, leaving the ETT in place. When rescuing the airway after failed laryngoscopy, intubating SGAs are preferred as they can facilitate a later exchange for an ETT. Nonintubating SGAs, such as the second-generation, single-use, LMA-supreme, will not accept an adult ETT and an exchange procedure, with removal of the SGA prior to endotracheal intubation, may be necessary.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen313">I. Extubation of the Trachea</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Criteria for routine postsurgical extubation are outlined in <strong><a href="#tt20-7">Table 20.7</a></strong>. After the patient is asked to open their mouth, a suction catheter is used to remove supraglottic secretions or blood. Some clinicians prefer to allow the airway pressure to rise to 5 to 15&#x00A0;cm of H<sub>2</sub>O to facilitate a &#x201C;passive cough,&#x201D; and the ETT is removed after the cuff (if present) is deflated. If coughing or straining is contraindicated or hazardous (eg, in the presence of an increased intracranial pressure), extubation may be performed with the patient in a surgical plane of anesthesia and breathing spontaneously (&#x201C;deep&#x201D; extubation). There are three requirements for deep extubation: (1) excellent mask fit and ventilation during induction, (2) no surgical manipulation of the<a id="page435"></a> airway, and (3) absence of a full stomach. Extubation of the trachea has its own set of potential complications and may prove more perilous than the act of intubation<sup><a href="#bib13">13</a></sup> (<strong><a href="#tt20-8">Table 20.8</a></strong>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Difficult Extubation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Airway obstruction is a common cause of extubation failure. Incomplete recovery from neuromuscular relaxation, aspirated blood, and edema of the uvula, soft palate, tongue, and glottic structures all may contribute to the obstruction.<sup><a href="#bib13">13</a></sup> Laryngospasm upon ETT removal may also cause extubation failure and accounts for 23% of all critical postoperative respiratory events in adults.<sup><a href="#bib4">4</a></sup> Unilateral vocal cord paralysis may result from trauma to the recurrent laryngeal nerve during surgery in the neck. Airway obstruction can occur if the contralateral nerve has been damaged previously. Transient vocal cord and swallowing dysfunction has been demonstrated in the absence of injury, placing even healthy patients at risk of aspiration after general anesthesia.</p>
<p class="indent">Pharmacologic agents used during the maintenance and emergence phases of the anesthetic also may affect the success of extubation. Although low concentrations of inhalation anesthetics (eg, 0.2 minimal alveolar concentration) do not alter the respiratory response to carbon dioxide, they may blunt hypoxic drive. Opiates, and to a lesser extent benzodiazepines, affect both hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory drives. Some nondepolarizing muscle relaxants may also reduce the hypoxic ventilatory drive.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Identification of Patients at Risk for Complications at Time of Extubation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">All patients should be evaluated for the potential of difficult extubation just as they are evaluated for potential difficult intubation. A number of well-known clinical situations may place patients at increased risk for difficulty with oxygenation or ventilation at the time of extubation (<strong><a href="#tt20-9">Table 20.9</a></strong>). Management strategies range from continued ventilation to the preparation of standby reintubation equipment to the active establishment of a bridge or guide for reintubation or oxygenation. A number of obturators, which<a id="page436"></a> may be left in the airway for extended periods, are available for use in trial extubation. These devices are generally referred to as airway exchange catheters (AECs). The success of first-pass reintubation is significantly higher, and the incidence of hypoxia is lower, in patients with a retained exchange catheter.<sup><a href="#bib14">14</a></sup> AECs have been associated with significant morbidity, though, including loss of airway control, mucosal trauma, pneumothorax, esophageal intubation, and death.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen314">J. The Difficult Airway Algorithm</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>The ASA Difficult Airway Algorithm</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Difficult and failed airway management accounts for 2.3% of anesthetic deaths in the United States. The ASA defines the difficult airway as the situation in which the &#x201C;conventionally trained anesthesiologist experiences difficulty with intubation, mask ventilation, or both&#x201D; and has designed the <strong><em>difficult airway algorithm</em></strong> (ASA-DAA, <strong><a href="#ff20-7">Figure 20.7</a></strong>) to address such a scenario.<sup><a href="#bib11">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Entry into the algorithm begins with the evaluation of the airway, which should direct the clinician to enter the ASA-DAA at one of its two root points: awake intubation (<strong><a href="#ff20-7">Figure 20.7</a></strong>, Box A) or intubation attempts after the induction of general anesthesia (<strong><a href="#ff20-7">Figure 20.7</a></strong>, Box B). Awake intubation is chosen when difficulty is anticipated that will place the patient&#x2019;s life in jeopardy, while the airway management after induction is chosen when an uncorrectable situation is not expected.</p>
<a id="page437"></a>

<h6 class="h6">The Airway Approach Algorithm</h6>
<p class="nonindent">This has been further delineated in a preoperative decision tree by Rosenblatt<sup><a href="#bib15">15</a></sup> known as the <strong><em>airway approach algorithm (AAA)</em></strong>. <strong><a href="#ff20-8">Figure 20.8</a></strong> outlines the AAA, a simple one-pathway algorithm for entering the ASA-DAA, which follows five steps:</p>
<ol class="u_num1">
<li><span><strong><em>Is airway control necessary?</em></strong> Can regional or infiltrative anesthesia be applied?</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Could tracheal intubation be (at all) difficult?</em></strong> Based on the airway evaluation.</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Can supraglottic ventilation be used if needed?</em></strong> If both intubation and ventilation may be difficult, an awake intubation is chosen (<strong><a href="#ff20-7">Figure 20.7A</a></strong>).</span></li>
<li><span><a id="page438"></a><strong><em>Is there an aspiration risk?</em></strong> The patient at risk for aspiration is not a candidate for elective SGA use. If intubation is also evaluated to be difficult, <strong><a href="#ff20-7">Figure 20.7A</a></strong> is chosen.</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Will the patient tolerate an apneic period?</em></strong> Should intubation fail and SGA ventilation is inadequate, will the patient rapidly desaturate? If so, awake intubation is the better choice (<strong><a href="#ff20-7">Figure 20.7A</a></strong>).</span></li>

<p class="indent">The ASA-DAA becomes truly useful with the unanticipated difficult airway. When initial attempts fail, the airway is supported via mask ventilation. Then, if needed, the clinician may turn to the most convenient or appropriate technique for establishing tracheal intubation. The number of laryngoscopy attempts should be limited as serial attempts increase the incidence of complications.<sup><a href="#bib16">16</a></sup> This is because laryngoscopy can result in soft-tissue trauma, which may diminish the efficacy of a rescue facemask or supraglottic ventilation. When mask ventilation fails, the algorithm suggests supraglottic ventilation via an SGA. Should SGA ventilation fail to sustain the patient adequately, the emergency pathway is entered and the ASA-DAA suggests the use of transtracheal oxygenation or a surgical airway. Although several commercial kits are available for such situations, data suggest that a scalpel-based technique, with or without a bougie, may be optimal.<sup><a href="#bib13">13</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen315">K. Awake Airway Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Awake airway management provides maintenance of spontaneous ventilation and airway protection in the event that the airway cannot be secured rapidly. A sedative agent can be used during awake intubation, but the clinician must remember that producing obstruction or apnea in the patient with a difficult airway can be devastating. Administration of an antisialagogue, commonly atropine or <a id="page439"></a>glycopyrrolate, is important to the success of awake intubation techniques as even small amounts of liquid can obscure the objective lens of indirect optical instruments (eg, flexible or rigid intubating scope, videolaryngoscope). Vasoconstriction of the nasal passages is also required for instrumentation of this part of the airway.</p>
<div class="figureu5" id="ff20-9"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff20-9.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="ucaption"><span class="u_fignum">Figure&#160;20.9</span> Areas of local anesthetic delivery for awake airway management: The nasal cavity/nasopharynx (A), pharynx/base of tongue (B), hypopharynx, and (C) larynx/trachea.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Elective awake intubation is relatively contraindicated by inability to cooperate (eg, child, profound mental retardation, intoxication) and allergy to local anesthetics.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Local anesthetics are a cornerstone of awake airway control techniques (see <a href="ch012.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>). Both topical anesthesia and injected nerve block techniques are commonly used to blunt airway reflexes and provide analgesia. This chapter focuses on the noninvasive options.</p>
<p class="indent">The clinician directs local anesthetic therapy to three anatomic areas: the nasal cavity/nasopharynx, the pharynx/base of tongue, and the hypopharynx/larynx/trachea (<strong><a href="#ff20-9">Figure 20.9</a></strong>). To address the nasopharynx, cotton-tipped applicators soaked in local anesthetic are passed along the lower border of the nasal cavity until the posterior wall of the nasopharynx is reached and are left in place for 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">The glossopharyngeal nerve can be blocked as its branches transverse behind the palatoglossal folds. These folds are seen as soft-tissue ridges that extend from the posterior border of the soft palate to the base of the tongue. A noninvasive technique employs anesthetic-soaked cotton-tipped applicators positioned against the inferior-most aspect of the folds and left in place for 3 to 5 minutes. In many instances, topical application of anesthetics in the pharyngeal/hypopharyngeal cavities provides adequate analgesia of the hypopharynx, larynx, and trachea. Additional anesthetic agents can also be injected down the working channel of a flexible intubation scope.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Tracheostomy Intubation</strong></p>
<p class="indent">When awake intubation fails, the clinician has a number of options. They include cancellation of a nonemergent surgical case until specialized equipment or personnel can be arranged for, the use of regional anesthetic techniques or, if demanded by the situation, a surgical airway (eg, tracheostomy).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen316">L. The Flexible Intubation Scope in Airway Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong><em>flexible intubation scope</em></strong> is the most versatile tool available in situations when it is difficult, or dangerous, to create a direct line of sight to the glottis. The scope allows a practitioner to maneuver past many pathologic airway obstructions as well as normal anatomy that cannot be manipulated safely (eg, the unstable or fixed cervical spine). Unlike many other devices, the flexible intubation scope also allows visualization of structures below the level of the vocal folds. This is helpful in characterizing subglottic pathology as well as verifying tracheal tube placement. The choice of oral or nasal intubation is based on clinical requirements, surgical needs, operator experience, and other intubation techniques available if flexible scope intubation fails. Contraindications to flexible scope intubation are relative (<strong><a href="#tt20-10">Table 20.10</a></strong>). Although flexible scope intubation is a versatile and vital technique, there are several pitfalls. <strong><a href="#tt20-11">Table 20.11</a></strong> lists the most common reasons for failure.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen317">M. The SGAs in the Failed Airway</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Failed intubations and failed mask ventilation can be rescued with SGA insertion. The major disadvantage of the SGAs in resuscitation is the lack of mechanical protection from regurgitation and aspiration, which is a secondary concern in the face of life-threatening hypoxemia.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen318">N. Transtracheal Procedures</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When intubation and mask and SGA ventilation fail, airway access via the extrathoracic trachea may be warranted (<strong><a href="#tt20-12">Table 20.12</a></strong>). These techniques range from minimally invasive (eg, retrograde wire&#x2013;aided intubation and percutaneous translaryngeal jet ventilation) to surgical (eg, cricothyrotomy and open tracheostomy). Although these techniques are beyond the scope of this chapter, it is important to be aware of their presence at the terminal end of the DAA.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the ASA&#x2019;s Taskforce on the difficult airway has given the medical community an immensely valuable tool in the approach to the patient with the difficult airway, the ASA&#x2019;s algorithm must be viewed as a starting point only. <a id="page441"></a>Judgment, experience, the clinical situation, and available resources all affect the appropriateness of the chosen pathway through, or divergence from, the algorithm. When managing the difficult airway, flexibility, not rigidity, prevails.</p>

<p class="dify">The clinician does not need to be expert with all airway equipment and techniques. No one device can be considered superior to another for all tasks. A broad range of approaches should be mastered so that the failure of one does not preclude safe airway management and emergency rescue.</p>
