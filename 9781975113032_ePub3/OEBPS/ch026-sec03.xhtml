<h5 class="h5" id="sen395">A. Spinal Cord Injuries</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Vehicle crashes are currently the leading cause of traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI). Injury most commonly affects the cervical column (57.4%), followed by thoracic (21.5%) and lumbosacral (13.8%) levels.<sup><a href="ch026-sec09.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> The initial trauma can result in irreversible neuronal damage (primary injury) that is &#x201C;complete&#x201D; (no spinal cord function distal to the injury) or &#x201C;incomplete&#x201D; (partial function <a id="page547"></a>distal to the injury) and is only modifiable by prevention. <strong><em>Secondary injury</em></strong> starts within minutes and is exacerbated by inflammation and edema, leading to further ischemia and neurologic deterioration. Focused medical care aims to limit its extent with careful coordinated management strategies.<sup><a href="ch026-sec09.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup> The American Spinal Injury Association score is used to classify the neurologic injury severity (<strong><a href="#tt26-1">Table 26.1</a></strong>). Incomplete neurologic injuries are eight times more common than complete injuries and may have a variety of presentations (<strong><a href="#tt26-2">Table 26.2</a></strong>).</p>

<h6 class="h6">Hemodynamic Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hypotension is common after TSCI and may be associated with intravascular volume depletion, tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, and neurogenic shock. <strong><em>Neurogenic shock</em></strong> is characterized by hypotension with or without bradycardia due to loss of sympathetic tone when the injury occurs at the level of T6 and above. Chronotropic agents or cardiac pacing may be required for the treatment of associated bradycardia. Optimizing spinal cord perfusion aims to reduce the risk of secondary injury to vulnerable cord tissue in the setting of adjacent injury and edema. This goal is frequently addressed by augmentation of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) above 85&#x00A0;mm Hg, which may be achieved with a combination of intravenous volume expansion, vasopressors, and inotropes. However, high-quality evidence is lacking to support an ideal management strategy, such as a target MAP or the duration after injury for which a higher cord perfusion pressure might alter neurologic outcome.<sup><a href="ch026-sec09.xhtml#bib6">6</a>,<a href="ch026-sec09.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup></p>
<h6 class="h6">Decompressive Surgery</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Decompression of the injured spinal cord and stabilization of the spinal column is generally required after TSCI. It follows the initial resuscitation and surgical management of other immediate life-threatening conditions such as traumatic brain injury or intra-abdominal hemorrhage. When decompression is performed within 24 hours of injury, evidence suggests neurologic outcome may be better.<sup><a href="ch026-sec09.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup></p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Scoliosis</strong></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen396">B. Scoliosis</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong>Scoliosis</strong> is defined as an abnormal lateral curvature of the spinal column in the coronal plane. It is frequently accompanied by a rotation deformity (<strong><a href="#tt26-3">Table 26.3</a></strong>). Its severity is assessed by the measurement of Cobb angle (<strong><a href="#ff26-1">Figure 26.1</a></strong>). Despite the application of a brace, progression of the curve to a Cobb angle &#x003E;45&#x00B0; generally requires surgery to stop further deterioration. When untreated, progressive scoliosis may lead to severe back pain, restrictive ventilatory impairment, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and pulmonary hypertension.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen397">C. Degenerative Vertebral Column Disease</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Adult degenerative spine disease is a leading cause of chronic pain and disability worldwide. <strong><em>Spondylosis</em></strong> is a term used to refer to a spectrum of degenerative conditions, including spinal stenosis, osteophyte formation, and intervertebral disc disease, any of which may be asymptomatic or accompanied by radiculopathy or myelopathy. Its etiology is uncertain (&#x003E;50% due to repetitive spine trauma), and it is generally managed nonoperatively. <strong><em>Spondylolisthesis</em></strong> refers to a loss of vertebral alignment as a result of forward displacement of one vertebra over another and most commonly affects the lumbosacral region. Management is generally conservative (physical therapy, multimodal analgesia, and epidural steroid injections), although progressive myelopathy, neuropathy, or loss of bowel or bladder control are all indications for surgical decompression with or without fusion.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen398">D. Anesthesia for Spine Surgery</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Spine surgery is indicated for the correction of vertebral column deformities and for decompression of nerves and spinal cord due to impingement from diseases of the disc, bone, tumors, and trauma.</p>
<a id="page550"></a>
<h6 class="h6">Airway</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cervical spine instability requires measures to minimize neck movement during tracheal intubation. All airway instruments and techniques can potentially cause movement in the cervical spine, but these are typically negligible. Thus, when carefully performed, no single technique has been shown superior in terms of neurologic outcomes. TSCI patients who require tracheal intubation in urgent or emergent circumstances and in the absence of other difficult airway issues can generally be safely managed with rapid sequence induction with bimanual cricoid pressure (see <a href="ch020.xhtml">Chapters 20</a> and <a href="ch032.xhtml">32</a>) and manual inline cervical spine stabilization (so that the front of the cervical collar can be temporarily removed to facilitate laryngoscopy). Video laryngoscopy may provide less neck movement and can be used for tracheal intubations in both awake and unconscious patients, particularly those with features predicting difficult laryngoscopy (eg, large neck circumference, limited mouth opening). Fiberoptic intubation is theoretically associated with minimal cervical spine movement, and frequently combined with video laryngoscopy for optimal management. &#x201C;Awake&#x201D; fiberoptic intubation is typically reserved for cooperative patients with a predicted difficult intubation where maintenance of spontaneous breathing would be advantageous. After intubation before cuff inflation, assessment and documentation of air leak enables more robust evaluation of readiness for extubation at the end of the surgery.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">In patients with cervical spine instability, no single airway management technique has been shown superior in preventing rare, tracheal intubation-related spinal cord injury.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Positioning</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Most spine surgery patients require prone positioning, although certain cervical and lumbar approaches require supine positioning, and some thoracic or minimally invasive lumbar procedures may require lateral positioning. The sitting position is preferred for some high posterior cervical surgeries, which may slightly increase the risk of venous air embolism (VAE). All such positioning requires careful attention to details of patient anatomy, vascular access lines, and monitoring equipment. This is facilitated by adequate numbers of personnel and proper equipment training for safety (<strong><a href="#ff26-2">Figures 26.2</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#ff26-3">26.3</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">The endotracheal tube and all vascular access lines must be secured adequately before turning from the supine to another position. A soft bite block will prevent tongue or endotracheal tube biting. Special spine tables allow the prone abdomen to hang free and reduce intraoperative bleeding by minimizing<a id="page551"></a> compression of abdominal contents (and attendant increases in vena cava and epidural venous pressure) as well as facilitating positive pressure ventilation. Slight reverse Trendelenburg tilt also limits the venous back pressure and bleeding. Foam- or gel-based face pillows or Mayfield pins are used to provide pressure-free positioning of the face, with the neck in a neutral position to prevent neurologic injury.</p>

Arms can be positioned either in swimmer position (<strong>left</strong>) or tucked at the sides (<strong>right</strong>), with the axillae and ulnar grooves free from direct pressure and the wrists and elbows padded.</figcaption></figure></div>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring and Access</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to standard American Society of Anesthesiologists monitors, an arterial catheter provides continuous blood pressure monitoring and facilitates blood sampling in selected cases of anticipated hemodynamic instability or large blood loss. At least two peripheral intravenous lines are ideal due to the restricted intraoperative extremity access that occurs with cervical spine procedures with arms tucked at the sides. Additional robust vascular access must be considered for procedures with higher risks of bleeding, such as scoliosis corrections, anterior lumbar approaches (risk of major vascular injury during exposure), and for resection of hypervascular lesions (such as tumors or infected bone). Central venous catheterization may be helpful for resuscitation and aspiration of intracardiac air if an air embolism occurs.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Prior to the advent of modern neurophysiologic monitoring of spinal cord function with motor- or sensory-evoked potentials, intraoperative assessment of spinal cord function was performed by the &#x201C;wake-up test,&#x201D; transiently reducing anesthetic depth during the surgical procedure to observe patient extremity movement in response to verbal commands.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Anesthetic Technique</h6>
<p class="nonindent">General anesthesia is required for most spine procedures. Because volatile anesthetics have variable effects on evoked potential monitoring of spinal cord function, total intravenous anesthesia is usually preferred in such cases, either alone or in combination with a low-dose (&#x003C;1 minimum alveolar concentration [MAC]) volatile agent (<strong><a href="#tt26-4">Table 26.4</a></strong>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen399">E. Spinal Cord Monitoring</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring</em></strong> of motor or sensory-evoked potentials in the central nervous system is used during spinal surgery to detect unintended spinal cord injury. It is also used to guide surgical and medical interventions to avoid permanent neurologic injury. Multimodal neurophysiologic monitoring (<strong><a href="#tt26-5">Table 26.5</a></strong>) is sensitive and specific to detect intraoperative neurologic injury, but evidence that it reduces the incidence of new or worsening neurologic deficits is weak.<sup><a href="ch026-sec09.xhtml#bib9">9</a></sup></p>

<h6 class="h6">Management of Acute Evoked Potential Signal Changes</h6>
<p class="nonindent">If an acute change in neurophysiologic monitoring is detected, the following steps should be taken to identify its cause and reverse the abnormality:</p>
<ul class="u_bullb"><li><span>Rule out surgical- and equipment-related factors; communicate with the surgeon and neuromonitoring team.</span></li>
<li><span>Reposition the patient (maintain natural alignment of spinal column).</span></li>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen400">F. Blood Transfusion Strategies</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Blood loss can be significant during spine surgery, with up to 80% of patients requiring an intraoperative transfusion. Perioperative blood loss and blood transfusion have potential negative consequences. Thus, various techniques <a id="page553"></a>have been proposed to minimize blood loss and blood product transfusion in this setting.<sup><a href="ch026-sec09.xhtml#bib10">10</a></sup> Along with meticulous surgical technique, maintenance of normothermia and avoiding acidosis will reduce bleeding. Goal-directed transfusion strategies by either rapid emergency hemorrhage panel (EHP) including hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, prothrombin time, and fibrinogen or point of care testing using viscoelastic hemostatic assays are increasingly used to guide blood product transfusion.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Preoperative Hemoglobin Optimization</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Preoperative hemoglobin levels of 12&#x00A0;g/dL for females and 13&#x00A0;g/dL for males serve as thresholds for anemia that generally require further attention in the preoperative period. Laboratory evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of existing anemia should occur before elective orthopedic procedures through correction of nutritional deficiencies, use of recombinant human erythropoietin, and oral or intravenous iron supplementation. Preoperative autologous blood donation and acute normovolemic hemodilution have been investigated for spine surgery but are not components of routine practice.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Antifibrinolytics</h6>
<p class="nonindent">TXA is the most common lysine analogue used as an antifibrinolytic to decrease perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements through the inhibition of clot degradation. Its use is contraindicated in cases of known allergy, history of thromboembolic disease, and preexisting seizure disorders. Potential adverse effects include thromboembolic events, seizures, and vision changes. The recommended dosing regimen is a 1&#x00A0;g bolus over 10 minutes following by an infusion of 1&#x00A0;g over 8 hours. In acute major trauma, initiation of TXA more than 3 hours after time of injury is associated with increased mortality.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cell Saver</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Evidence supports the use of intraoperative washed erythrocyte salvage in spine surgery, as autologous transfusion significantly lowers donor blood transfusion rates. Its use is controversial, however, during cancer surgery, bacterial infections, wound irrigation with antibiotics, and concurrent use of topical hemostatic agents.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen401">G. Visual Loss After Spine Surgery</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Perioperative visual loss (POVL)</em></strong> is a potentially devastating complication that can occur following spine surgery. Its incidence ranges from 0.03% to 0.2%, and it has several different types, presentations, and etiologies (<strong><a href="#tt26-6">Table 26.6</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">The following management strategies have been suggested for prevention of POVL in spine surgery patients with the risk factors noted in <strong><a href="#tt26-6">Table 26.6</a></strong><sup><a href="ch026-sec09.xhtml#bib11">11</a></sup>:</p>
<ul class="u_bullb"><li><span>POVL should be discussed as part of the preoperative informed consent.</span></li>
<li><span>Assess patient&#x2019;s baseline blood pressure.</span></li>
<li><span>Continually monitor blood pressure in high-risk patients.</span></li>
<li><span>Avoid deliberate hypotension in high-risk patients.</span></li>
<li><span>The neck should be placed in a neutral position, and the head should be level with or higher than the heart to minimize venous congestion.</span></li>
<li><span>Maintain adequate intravascular volume with balanced combinations of crystalloids, colloids, and blood products.</span></li>
<li><span>For prolonged operations, consideration should be given for staging the surgery.</span></li></ul>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen402">H. Venous Air Embolism</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Venous air embolism (VAE)</em></strong> results from entrainment of ambient air into the venous circulation through intraosseous vessels or open epidural veins at the surgical site. Procedures above the level of the right atrium that involve opening of large venous structures, including removal of large areas of cortical bone or procedures in sitting position, may carry higher VAE risk. When air accumulation in the right heart reaches a critical level to impact right ventricular output, cardiovascular collapse may occur. The risk of VAE is increased with hypovolemia, hypotension, and spontaneous ventilation and is decreased with positioning to allow epidural veins to remain below the heart level. VAE may be detected by echocardiography, precordial Doppler, or strongly suspected based on clinical presentation. The presentation and management of VAE are summarized in <strong><a href="#tt26-7">Table 26.7</a></strong>.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen403">I. Postoperative Care</h5>
<p class="nonindent">One in five spine surgery patients will develop immediate postoperative complications. Independent risk factors include male sex, advanced age, surgical approach (combined anterior and posterior approach being associated with the highest complication rates), and preexisting comorbidities. Hospital mortality rates are 0.2% to 0.5% and are associated most often with concomitant congestive heart failure, liver disease, coagulopathy, neurologic disorders, renal disease, electrolyte imbalances, and pulmonary circulatory diseases.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Decision to Extubate</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Anterior cervical fusion surgeries carry the particular risk of hematoma and edema formation up to 36 hours after surgery and tracheal extubation. This may lead to postoperative airway compromise and the need for emergent reintubation. Operative injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve may also cause vocal cord dysfunction and respiratory difficulty. There are no uniformly accepted criteria to guide extubation decisions. Potential risk factors for postoperative reintubation include advanced age, higher American Society of<a id="page555"></a> Anesthesiologists&#x2019; class, extent of the procedure and its duration, administered fluid volume, blood loss &#x003E;300&#x00A0;mL, combined anterior and posterior cervical approach, and previous spine surgery.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Pain Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Postoperative pain is a major concern following spine surgery and is frequently complicated by preoperative chronic pain, long-term opioid use, and related psychosocial issues. <strong><em>Multimodal analgesic management</em></strong> is recommended in such patients. Combining analgesics with different mechanisms of action such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, gabapentin, dexamethasone, ketamine, and lidocaine facilitates early mobilization, reduces opioid consumption, and improves patient satisfaction. There is no single optimal multimodal analgesic regimen, so individual patient factors must be considered to maximize likely benefits and reduce the risk of serious side effects. For example, while helpful for some patients, gabapentinoids potentiate the respiratory depressant effects of opioids and should be used with caution in vulnerable patients, such as those with obstructive sleep apnea.<sup><a href="ch026-sec09.xhtml#bib12">12</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen404">J. Neuraxial and Regional Anesthesia for Spine Surgery</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Neuraxial (spinal subarachnoid or epidural) anesthesia may be used for lumbar or lower thoracic microdiscectomy or laminectomy surgery that is limited to one or two levels. It has the potential to reduce intraoperative blood loss through the combined effects of sympathetic blockade (leading to vasodilation and relative hypotension) and maintenance of spontaneous ventilation<a id="page556"></a> (which lowers intrathoracic ventilation pressures and reduces congestion of the epidural veins). Neuraxial anesthesia also provides postoperative analgesia and can reduce opioid requirements, nausea and vomiting, and urinary retention. Bilateral erector spinae plane blocks or retrolaminar blocks are showing promise as alternative strategies.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Regional anesthesia, using both single-shot and indwelling catheter techniques, is increasingly common for both inpatient and outpatient orthopedic extremity surgery. It is used not only for intraoperative anesthesia but also for the many benefits of prolonged postoperative analgesia.</p>
