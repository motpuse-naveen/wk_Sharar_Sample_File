<h5 class="h5" id="sen150">A. Neuromuscular Effects</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Succinylcholine is the only depolarizing NMBA clinically available (<strong><a href="#tt11-1">Table 11.1</a></strong>; <strong><a href="#ff11-3">Figure 11.3</a></strong>). Because of its molecular similarity to ACh, SCh depolarizes both postsynaptic and extrajunctional receptors, although not prejunctional<a id="page215"></a> neuronal nAChRs. The mechanism of paralysis is related to prolonged attachment to the AChR, inactivation of muscle membrane Na<sup>+</sup> channels, and lack of metabolism by acetylcholinesterase. Initial receptor activation manifests clinically as muscle &#x201C;fasciculations&#x201D;; thereafter, muscle membrane polarization cannot be reestablished, and flaccid paralysis persists.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen151">B. Characteristics of Depolarizing Blockade</h5>
<p class="nonindent">As with all NMBAs, increasing the dose of SCh leads to a progressive decrease in force of muscle contraction. However, the response to repetitive stimulation (train-of-four, TOF, and tetanus patterns, see Monitoring Modalities) is maintained (no fade) because SCh has no affinity for the presynaptic neuronal nAChRs, allowing ACh to continue to signal ACh vesicles to move to the active zone. Additionally, after a brief period of high-frequency stimulation (tetanus), there is no increase or amplification in the force of subsequent muscle contractions (no posttetanic potentiation). Large doses (7-10&#x00A0;mg/kg), prolonged (&#x003E;30 minutes) exposure to SCh, presence of atypical pseudocholinesterase, or plasma cholinesterase deficiency may lead to phase II block. This is characterized by fade of responses to repetitive stimulation and amplification of muscle responses after high-frequency stimulation (posttetanic potentiation), similar to a nondepolarizing block.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">There are also nAChRs on the nerve terminal that signal the migration of ACh vesicles to the active zone. Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants bind and inactivate these receptors leading to fade with successive nerve stimulations. Succinylcholine does not bind these presynaptic nAChR receptors, so there is no fade with successive nerve stimulations.</p>

The data are averages obtained from published literature, assuming there is no potentiation from other coadministered drugs (such as volatile inhalational anesthetics) and the effects are measured at the adductor pollicis muscle.

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen152">C. Pharmacology of Succinylcholine</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The onset of SCh at peripheral muscles (such as adductor pollicis muscle) is the fastest of any NMBA (1-2 minutes). Its ED<sub>95</sub> is approximately 0.30&#x00A0;mg/kg, and at doses of 1 to 1.5&#x00A0;mg/kg (3-5&#x00A0;&#x00D7;&#x00A0;ED<sub>95</sub>), the DUR 25% of SCh is 10 to 12 minutes. In large doses, the DUR 25% is prolonged beyond 15 minutes. The recovery from SCh is slower than from rocuronium when sugammadex is administered for reversal (<strong><a href="#ff11-4">Figure 11.4</a></strong>). SCh is most commonly administered intravenously (IV), but intraosseous, intralingual, and intramuscular routes<a id="page217"></a> have been successfully reported if an IV cannot be established. Onset is delayed with these alternative routes, particularly with intramuscular administration.</p>

<p class="indent">Hydrolysis of SCh by plasma cholinesterase (also known as pseudocholinesterase or butyrylcholinesterase) occurs away from the neuromuscular junction in the plasma. Plasma cholinesterase activity may be reduced in liver disease, pregnancy, acute infection, uremia, burns, with oral contraceptive use, and in some forms of cancer. A variant of plasma cholinesterase, atypical pseudocholinesterase, does not metabolize SCh efficiently. Heterozygous atypical pseudocholinesterase occurs in approximately 1:250 patients and leads to prolonged SCh effect of approximately 30 minutes. Homozygous atypical pseudocholinesterase is uncommon (1:3000) and leads to up to 8 hours of paralysis after SCh administration. Dibucaine is a local anesthetic that very effectively inactivates normal plasma cholinesterase, reducing activity by 80% to 100%. It inactivates atypical pseudocholinesterase less well&#x2014;40% to 60% with heterozygous atypical pseudocholinesterase and 20% with homozygous atypical pseudocholinesterase. The dibucaine number reflects the degree of enzyme inhibition and can be used clinically to elucidate the cause of prolonged paralysis after succinylcholine administration.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Almost 90% of the intravenous dose of SCh is hydrolyzed in the plasma before reaching the neuromuscular junction.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen153">D. Side Effects</h5>
<p class="nonindent">SCh can induce significant bradycardia or even asystole, particularly in children, and after redosing. Premature ventricular escape beats are also common. Cardiac effects can be attenuated by pretreatment with anticholinergics. Disorganized muscle contractions (fasciculations) after SCh administration are very common (80%-90% of patients). Myalgias are also very common 1 to 2&#x00A0;days postoperatively (50%-60% of patients). The relationship between fasciculations and myalgias is unclear; a &#x201C;defasciculating&#x201D; pretreatment with a small dose of nondepolarizing NMBA (10% ED<sub>95</sub>) appears to have limited<a id="page218"></a> effect on the risk of myalgias. If pretreatment is used, the dose requirement for SCh is increased (up to 2&#x00A0;mg/kg). The most effective myalgia prophylaxis interventions are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, aspirin or diclofenac), lidocaine (1-1.5&#x00A0;mg/kg), and rocuronium (0.05&#x00A0;mg/kg), with a numbers-needed-to-treat of approximately 2 to 3.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Although SCh may increase intragastric pressure, lower esophageal sphincter tone is also increased, such that the intragastric-esophageal pressure gradient remains the same. Thus, there is no increase in the risk of aspiration from the use of SCh. Intraocular pressure (IOP) also increases with SCh (up to 15&#x00A0;mm Hg), and pretreatment with a nondepolarizing NMDA does not attenuate this increase. The mechanism includes arterial dilation and perhaps ocular muscle contraction. SCh-induced increase in IOP is unlikely to lead to clinically impactful extrusion of ocular contents in patients with an open-globe injury, so SCh does not need to be avoided in this situation. Elevation in intracranial pressure from SCh may occur, though there is evidence to the contrary.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup> More importantly, inadequate levels of anesthesia during laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation increase intracranial pressure. Although SCh administration induces an elevation in the plasma level of potassium of 0.5 mEq/L, severe hyperkalemia with attendant cardiac arrest has only been reported in cases in which there is a proliferation of immature nAChRs (see &#x201C;Receptor Up- and Downregulation&#x201D;). Particularly important is the association between pediatric myotonia and muscle dystrophies and SCh administration, leading to fatal hyperkalemia and rhabdomyolysis. For this reason, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has a black box warning on the use of SCh, and clinicians should avoid its use in children. SCh may also trigger lethal malignant hyperthermia (MH), especially in patients anesthetized with volatile anesthetics.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> Some patients (both adults and children) may exhibit masseter muscle spasm after SCh administration, making intubating conditions difficult. SCh can produce allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) in about 1 of 10,000 administrations.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen154">E. Clinical Uses</h5>
<p class="nonindent">SCh is indicated for rapid attainment of optimal intubating conditions and prevention of regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents in patients at risk (those unfasted, with gastroparesis or gastrointestinal obstruction) in the rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) scenario. SCh has the shortest onset time (1 minute at 1.5&#x00A0;mg/kg) and a short clinical duration (5-10 minutes at 1&#x00A0;mg/kg dose). The short onset of action may be offset by a faster time to desaturation in patients given succinylcholine compared to those given rocuronium.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup> In obese individuals who need RSII, the dose of SCh should be calculated on the basis of actual body weight, rather than ideal body weight. Children are more resistant than adults to the actions of SCh, and the usual dose (see &#x201C;Side Effects&#x201D;) is 1.5 to 2.0&#x00A0;mg/kg (up to 3&#x00A0;mg/kg in infants).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen155">F. Contraindications to Use of Succinylcholine</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Use of SCh is contraindicated in patients (and their relatives) with a history of MH. Other settings in which SCh is contraindicated include states of receptor upregulation such as critical care patients or those immobilized for prolonged periods (eg, weeks) due to the potential for lethal hyperkalemia. Due to upregulation of immature nAChR, succinylcholine should be avoided 48 hour after a burn or denervation process. This danger persists for the duration of the disease process.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib6">6</a></sup> In patients with renal failure, SCh may be administered if the<a id="page219"></a> plasma K<sup>+</sup> is not elevated. Lethal hyperkalemia following administration of SCh has been reported in severely acidotic and hypovolemic patients. Finally, SCh should be avoided in patients with pseudocholinesterase deficiency or atypical pseudocholinesterase.</p>
