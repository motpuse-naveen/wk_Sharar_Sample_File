<h4 class="h4" id="sec227">II. Valvular Heart Disease</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Growing experience with TEE has significantly increased the role of anesthesiologists in the intraoperative evaluation and management of valvular heart disease (VHD). VHD can <a id="page769"></a>be classified into two primary lesions: <strong><em>regurgitant</em></strong> and <strong><em>stenotic</em></strong>. <em>Regurgitant lesions</em> lead to volume overload, while <em>stenotic valve disease</em> leads to pressure overload. Although disease of the tricuspid and pulmonic valves presents unique challenges to the anesthesiologist, this chapter will focus on the much more common left-sided valvular lesions. Additional information is provided in the 2014 AHA/ACC &#x201C;Guidelines for the Management of Patients with VHD.&#x201D;<sup><a href="ch036-sec08.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen640">A. Aortic Stenosis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The normal adult aortic valve comprises three equally sized cusps and has an area of 2 to 3.5&#x00A0;cm<sup>2</sup>. Aortic stenosis (AS) is the <strong><em>most common</em></strong> valvular lesion in the heart and can result from congenital or acquired valvular disease. In congenital AS, there is a partial or complete commissural fusion between cusps, resulting in a unicuspid or bicuspid valve. A bicuspid aortic valve is the most commonly occurring congenital heart defect, affecting approximately 1% to 2% of the population. Bicuspid aortic valves are associated with other congenital abnormalities, specifically diseases of the aorta including coarctation and dilatation of the aortic root. Acquired aortic stenosis results from calcific degeneration or, less commonly, rheumatic disease.</p>

<p class="indent">Progressive narrowing of the aortic valve leads to an increased transvalvular gradient. This in turn increases the work of the LV and over time results in <strong><em>concentric ventricular hypertrophy</em></strong>. This compensatory response allows the internal diameter of the LV to remain unchanged and preserves systolic function and stroke volume. However, as the LV thickens, its diastolic function declines, causing an increase in the diastolic filling pressure. Patients often remain asymptomatic until the valve area is&#x00A0;&#x003C;1 to 1.2&#x00A0;cm<sup>2</sup>, correlating to a peak transvalvular gradient exceeding 50&#x00A0;mm Hg. The classic triad of symptomatic AS is <strong><em>angina</em></strong>, <strong><em>syncope</em></strong>, and <strong><em>congestive heart failure</em></strong> (dyspnea). The development of any of these is <strong><em>ominous</em></strong>, indicating a life expectancy from 2 to 5&#x00A0;years without valve replacement.</p>
<p class="indent">The consequence of elevated intraventricular pressure and concentric hypertrophy is increased myocardial oxygen demand. At the same time, diastolic filling pressure is increased, resulting in a lower coronary perfusion pressure. Thus, patients with severe AS may experience myocardial ischemia and angina in the absence of CAD, especially if the heart rate increases much beyond resting levels (see prior discussion in the section &#x201C;Myocardial Oxygen Demand&#x201D;). Maintenance of <strong><em>systemic vascular resistance (SVR)</em></strong> is critical in patients with AS to ensure adequate aortic diastolic pressure and thus coronary perfusion pressure. Vasoconstrictors such as vasopressin or phenylephrine will increase SVR without increasing myocardial oxygen demand because the increase in systemic blood pressure they cause is not &#x201C;seen&#x201D; by the LV due to the stenotic aortic valve.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen641">B. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although not a disease of a valve, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can cause an obstructive lesion similar to that of AS. HCM is an uncommon autosomal dominant genetic disorder with highly variable penetrance. It leads to ventricular hypertrophy that occurs in varying patterns, not just involving the interventricular septum. Presenting symptoms are often dyspnea on exertion, poor exercise tolerance, syncope, palpitations, and fatigue. Some patients remain asymptomatic much of their lives and unfortunately are diagnosed after sudden cardiac death.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page770"></a>Approximately one-third of patients with HCM will have hypertrophy of the interventricular septum that leads to <strong><em>dynamic obstruction</em></strong> of the left ventricular outflow tract. The resulting pressure gradient increases throughout systole, creating obstruction to cardiac output. Any factor decreasing left ventricular size will increase this gradient and further obstruct cardiac output. Examples include increases in heart rate and contractility and decreases in preload and afterload. Therefore, anesthetic management focuses on avoiding tachycardia and maintaining euvolemia and normal systemic vascular resistance. Hypotension in this population is best treated with &#x03B1;-adrenergic agonists and volume. Treatment with inotropic drugs such as <strong><em>epinephrine is contraindicated</em></strong> and may worsen the dynamic obstruction and hypotension.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Aortic Insufficiency TEE Clip</strong></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen642">C. Aortic Insufficiency</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Aortic insufficiency (AI) can be the result of primary valvular disease or in association with aortic root dilatation (Marfan disease, degenerative aortic dilatation, aortic dissection) despite a normal aortic valve. The natural progression of AI varies depending on the pathophysiology and chronicity of the disease.</p>
<p class="indent">Acute AI is often the result of traumatic injury to the aortic root or valvular endocarditis. The consequences of <strong><em>acute AI</em></strong> are immediate and profound volume overload to the LV. Frequently, the LV is not able to maintain forward stroke volume despite compensatory mechanisms, including increased sympathetic tone, leading to tachycardia and increased contractility. Rapid deterioration of left ventricular function develops, leading to dyspnea and eventual cardiovascular collapse. Acute AI often requires urgent or emergent surgical intervention.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Chronic AI</em></strong> results in an increased left ventricular end diastolic volume that over time leads to eccentric hypertrophy (cavity dilatation). The course of chronic AI is gradual, limiting the increase in left ventricular diastolic pressure. It is not typical for patients to develop symptoms associated with AI until decades into the disease process when the LV has significantly dilated and myocardial dysfunction occurs. Once symptomatic, life expectancy diminishes dramatically, with expected survival of only 5 to 10&#x00A0;years.</p>
<p class="indent">The anesthetic management of AI focuses on <strong><em>preserving forward stroke volume</em></strong> and minimizing regurgitant volume by maintaining a relatively rapid heart rate (about 90 beats per minute) and normal to low SVR.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen643">D. Mitral Stenosis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The mitral valve area is typically 4 to 6&#x00A0;cm<sup>2</sup> and is made up of an anterior and posterior leaflet. Mitral stenosis is almost always due to <strong><em>rheumatic heart disease</em></strong> and is therefore quite rare in the United States and other highly developed nations. It leads to impaired filling of the LV and a resulting decreased stroke volume. Consequently, the <strong><em>left atrial pressure</em></strong> becomes chronically elevated, resulting in left atrial dilatation and increased pulmonary venous pressure. Patients with mitral stenosis are at high risk for developing <strong><em>atrial fibrillation</em></strong>, which may be the presenting sign of the disease. Mitral stenosis patients are often asymptomatic for decades until the mitral valve area has decreased to 1 to 1.5&#x00A0;cm<sup>2</sup> and the heart is faced with an increased demand for systemic stroke volume (exercise, pregnancy, infection). Any high cardiac output state or the onset of atrial fibrillation can cause significant increases in the left atrial and pulmonary arterial pressures, leading to acute <strong><em>congestive heart failure</em></strong>. Chronically elevated left atrial pressures lead to increases in pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary hypertension, restrictive lung disease, and right heart failure.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="images/tt36-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Frequently, patients with mitral stenosis have received diuretics preoperatively to control their pulmonary congestion and are relatively hypovolemic. Induction of anesthesia may unmask the <strong><em>hypovolemia</em></strong> and compromise the transit of blood across the stenotic mitral valve. Thus, adequate fluid administration during anesthesia is crucial, but too much fluid administration can lead to further pulmonary congestion and pulmonary edema. A relatively <strong><em>slow heart rate</em></strong> (about 60-70 beats per minute) allows ample time for the LV to fill. Tachycardia compromises that filling and may result in severe hypotension. <strong><em>SVR</em></strong> should be maintained to ensure adequate coronary perfusion pressure, especially to the RV because it is facing increased pulmonary artery pressures.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Mitral Regurgitation TEE Clip</strong></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen644">E. Mitral Regurgitation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Mitral regurgitation (MR) results from excessive leaflet motion (prolapse or flail) or restricted leaflet motion (ischemic dilatation, rheumatic heart disease). Similar to AI, MR leads to volume overload. In MR, the stroke volume is made up of blood ejected into the systemic circulation and then regurgitated into the left atrium. The regurgitated blood causes left atrial and ventricular dilatation (eccentric ventricular hypertrophy) and increased ventricular compliance. Unless the MR is due to CAD (eg, ischemic rupture of a papillary muscle), an elevated heart rate (about 90 beats per minute) may be best because it will limit ventricular dilatation. However, the cornerstone in the management of MR is <strong><em>reduction of the SVR</em></strong> to promote forward ejection of blood and limit regurgitation. In patients with MR and others undergoing valvular heart surgery, TEE has proven beneficial to assess volume status, ventricular function, and, most important, the adequacy of the surgical procedure. <strong><a href="#tt36-2">Table 36.2</a></strong> summarizes the hemodynamic goals in patients with VHD.</p>
