<h5 class="h5" id="sen762">A. Alternating and Direct Currents</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Electrical current causes the stimulation of nerves and can stimulate direct muscle contraction; this leads to the possibility of therapeutic uses but also the<a id="page911"></a> risk of injury or death. Direct current is generally considered to be safer than alternating current; the amount of direct current necessary to induce ventricular fibrillation is around three times higher than the amount of alternating current required to produce the same effect. <strong><a href="#tt44-1">Table 44.1</a></strong> summarizes the physical effects that are experienced from exposure to different thresholds of 60&#x00A0;Hz alternating current as is encountered in the standard US &#x201C;mains&#x201D; electricity supply.</p>

<p class="indent">The perception of the safety of direct current is reinforced by daily experience of &#x201C;mains&#x201D; alternating current being more powerful and dangerous than the relatively small amounts of direct current that are produced from standard batteries. However, a large direct current source such as an automobile battery or marine battery should not be considered harmless&#x2014;the direct current discharge that can be produced between the terminals can cause significant burns and musculoskeletal injury.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen763">B. Source of Shocks</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Whenever a difference in electrical potential exists, current will flow through a suitable conductor placed between those electrical potentials. Consequently, there is always a risk of electrical shock whenever an external source of electricity is touched. The severity of the physical effect of the shock depends upon both the magnitude of the electrical current and the duration of time for which that current is applied. At lower current levels, the electrical shock is first felt as a sensory tingling sensation, rising to pain with increased levels of current. Greater levels of current are able to stimulate contraction of muscles directly, and beyond a certain current level, it becomes impossible to release the contraction of these muscles voluntarily. Beyond this &#x201C;let-go&#x201D; threshold, <a id="page912"></a>it may no longer be possible for a victim to break contact with the source of electrical shock, further sustaining the electrical exposure.<sup><a href="ch044-sec06.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup> Further escalations in current can cause the onset of ventricular fibrillation as the electrical shock interferes with cardiac conduction and causes direct paralysis of the respiratory muscles. The flow of electrical current through the body also generates heat and can destroy tissue through direct thermal injury. The risk of burning is greatest at the points where the electrical current is entering or leaving the body, as the concentration of electrical current (the <strong><em>current density</em></strong>) is greatest there.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen764">C. Grounding</h5>
<p class="nonindent">When electrical current flows through a person, causing a shock, the shock is usually flowing from some other electrical potential to ground. The body of the person is usually either in direct contact with the ground, or electrically connected to the ground via a conductor such as an item of metal furniture. Since an electrical shock can only occur when there is a difference in electrical potential, the aim of electrical safety is to minimize that potential difference so that the magnitude of that electrical shock to ground is made as small as possible. One approach, as seen in small battery-powered devices, is to minimize the total electrical voltage used by the device to such an extent that even the maximum possible shock current that could be generated by it is harmless. However, for devices that require significant electrical power, electrical safety must be achieved by more active means, and in this case, &#x201C;grounding&#x201D; refers to the various steps that we can take to reduce the magnitude of the possible electrical shock.</p>
<p class="indent">The simplest of these is illustrated in <strong><a href="#ff44-1">Figure 44.1</a></strong>. On the right, a malfunctioning device is shown: it has developed a fault in which a conductor connected to the &#x201C;hot&#x201D; or &#x201C;live&#x201D; wire of the electrical supply has broken and is now in contact with the casing of the device. Touching the case poses an immediate risk of electric shock because it is possible for this live voltage to flow through the body to ground. However, as a safety precaution, the device also contains a &#x201C;ground&#x201D; or &#x201C;earth&#x201D; wire which is connected to ground voltage and also to the casing of the device. The electrical current from the case<a id="page913"></a> fault is, therefore, able to flow to ground either through the body of the person touching the device, or through the ground wire. Since the electrical resistance of the ground wire is much lower than the resistance of the body, most of the electrical current will preferentially travel to ground through the ground wire, reducing but not eliminating the magnitude of the electrical shock current passing through the person. However, if the ground wire were to break, or if the device were connected instead to a two-pin electrical socket without a ground pin, then the protection afforded by the ground wire would be entirely lost and the person touching the case would be exposed to the full magnitude of the electrical shock current.</p>
