<h5 class="h5" id="sen173">A. Anatomy of Nerves</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The neuron is the basic functional unit responsible for the conduction of neural impulses. It consists of a spherical cell body (soma) that contains the nucleus. The cell body is connected to several branching processes (dendrites), which transmit neural impulses to the neuron, and a single axon, which transmits neural impulses away from the cell body to other neurons (<strong><a href="#ff12-1">Figure 12.1A</a></strong>). Axons are cylinders of axoplasm encased within a lipid bilayer cell membrane that is embedded with various proteins, including voltage-gated sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>; VG<sub>Na</sub>) channels. Glial cells (oligodendrocytes in the <strong><em>central nervous system</em></strong> [CNS] and Schwann cells in the <strong><em>peripheral nervous system</em></strong>) are closely associated with neurons and function to support, insulate, and nourish axons. A nerve fiber is composed of an axon, its associated glial cell, and the surrounding endoneural connective tissue.</p>
<p class="indent">Peripheral nerve fibers are organized within three layers of connective tissue (<strong><a href="#ff12-1">Figure 12.1B</a></strong>). Individual nerve fibers are immediately surrounded by <strong><em>endoneurium</em></strong>, consisting of delicate connective tissue that consists of Schwann cells and fibroblasts along with capillaries. A dense layer of collagenous connective tissue, the <strong><em>perineurium</em></strong>, encloses bundles of nerve fibers into a fascicle. It functionally provides an effective barrier against penetration of the nerve fibers by foreign substances. The <strong><em>epineurium</em></strong> is also a dense connective tissue layer that surrounds and encases bundles of fascicles together into a cylindrical sheath structurally similar to a coaxial cable. It is looser in between fascicles, but denser and fibrous externally, where it forms the outer boundary of the nerve. An additional connective tissue layer that forms a <strong><em>paraneural</em></strong> sheath further encases peripheral nerves. Together, these tissue layers offer protection to peripheral nerves but also present a significant barrier to passive diffusion of local anesthetics toward the axonal cell membrane.</p>

<p class="indent">Peripheral nerves are mixed nerves containing both afferent and efferent nerve fibers that are either myelinated or nonmyelinated (<strong><a href="#ff12-1">Figure 12.1A</a></strong>). Myelinated nerve fibers contain axons, which are concentrically wrapped multiple times by the cell membrane (neurolemma) of Schwann cells. These layers of neurolemma form a myelin sheath, which provide insulation around the nerve allowing electrical signals to travel the distance of the sheath with minimal attenuation. Voltage-gated sodium channels (VG<sub>Na</sub>) cluster on the axonal cell membrane in gaps between each Schwann cell, referred to as nodes of Ranvier. Nonmyelinated nerve fibers consist of multiple axons that are simultaneously encased by the neurolemma of a single Schwann cell. Voltage-gated sodium channels (VG<sub>Na</sub>) are uniformly distributed along the entire axon of nonmyelinated nerve fibers (<strong><a href="#tt12-1">Table 12.1</a></strong>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen174">B. Electrophysiology of Neural Conduction and Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Neural impulses are conducted along axons as action potentials, which are transient membrane depolarizations initiated by various mechanical, chemical, or thermal stimuli. Depolarization of the cell membrane is mediated primarily via rapid intracellular influx of Na<sup>+</sup> ions flowing down its electrochemical gradient through VG<sub>Na</sub>. As one area of the cell membrane is depolarized, the change in polarization is sensed by adjacent VG<sub>Na</sub>, which subsequently open and cause further depolarization. In nonmyelinated nerve fibers, this wave of<a id="page244"></a> depolarization propagates along the axon as sequential VG<sub>Na</sub> open. In myelinated nerve fibers, action potentials propagate by hopping between VG<sub>Na</sub> clustered in the nodes of Ranvier in a process known as <strong><em>saltatory conduction</em></strong>, which enhances the speed of signal transmission along the axon.</p>
<p class="indent">The potential energy utilized to facilitate electrical conduction down the axon is provided by an electrochemical concentration gradient across the cell membrane. Transmembrane Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> (potassium) pumps establish this gradient actively cotransporting three Na<sup>+</sup> ions out of the cell for every two K<sup>+</sup> ions into the cell. The resulting chemical concentration gradient favors the movement of Na<sup>+</sup> ions into the cell and K<sup>+</sup> ions out of the cell. At rest, the cell membrane is relatively more permeable to K<sup>+</sup> ions, preventing an influx of Na<sup>+</sup> ions while allowing for a passive efflux of K<sup>+</sup> ions down their concentration gradient and out of the cell. This creates a relative net excess of negatively charged ions (polarized) within the axoplasm. The difference in charge across the cell membrane is referred to as the resting membrane potential, which measures approximately &#x2212;60 to &#x2212;70&#x00A0;mV in the neuron.</p>
<p class="indent">The VG<sub>Na</sub> spans the axonal membrane and consists of an &#x03B1;-subunit and one or two varying auxiliary &#x03B2;-subunits. The &#x03B1;-subunit forms the ion-conducting pore of the VG<sub>Na</sub> and it comprises four homologous domains (I to IV), each with six &#x03B1;-helical transmembrane segments. The loops that link the S5 and S6 segments of the &#x03B1;-helices of each of the four domains are located extracellular, extending inward to form the narrowest section of the channel pore. They are believed to provide its ion selectivity.</p>
<p class="indent">At the resting membrane potential, the channel pore is in a resting (closed) conformation. Upon an initial depolarization, movement of the S1-S4 voltage-sensing segments leads to rearrangement of the S6 segment. This results in activation (opening) of the channel pore, inducing a sudden increase in Na<sup>+</sup> ion permeability. The resultant rapid inward Na<sup>+</sup> current activates and opens additional VG<sub>Na</sub>. This further accelerates depolarization until a threshold membrane potential is reached, triggering an action potential. During the depolarization phase, the inward Na<sup>+</sup> current flows into the axoplasm and spreads to the adjacent (inactive) cell membrane, resulting in a wave of sequential depolarization (and the action potential) propagating along the axon. Although the wave of depolarization spreads from the initial area of excitation in both directions, the just activated membrane behind the impulse is temporarily refractory to subsequent depolarization. Thus, the propagation of the impulse is unidirectional. The activated VG<sub>Na</sub> is inactivated within milliseconds by an additional conformational change. This leads to binding of the cytoplasmic loop located between domains III and IV to the cytoplasmic opening of the VG<sub>Na</sub> to form the rapid inactivation gate. The rapid inactivation gate functions as an intracellular blocking particle that folds into and blocks the channel pore. This rapid inactivation process is required for repetitive firing of action potentials in neural circuits and for control of excitability in neurons. Repolarization occurs due to a combination of a progressive decrease in the driving force for the inward Na<sup>+</sup> current and inactivation of VG<sub>Na</sub>. In addition, membrane depolarization simultaneously activates voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels. This leads to an outward positive current of K<sup>+</sup> ions, which in conjunction with VG<sub>Na</sub> inactivation eventually returns the axonal membrane to or just beyond (hyperpolarization) its resting membrane potential. In summary, inward positive currents, mediated by Na<sup>+</sup> ions, depolarize the membrane, and in contrast, outward positive currents, mediated by K<sup>+</sup> ions, repolarize the membrane.</p>
<a id="page245"></a>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen175">C. Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels and Interactions With Local Anesthetics</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Local anesthetics act at the axonal membrane by binding to a specific region within the &#x03B1;-subunit. This prevents VG<sub>Na</sub> activation, thus inhibiting the inward Na<sup>+</sup> current that mediates membrane depolarization. The binding site for local anesthetics is located within the channel pore and is formed from amino acid residues in the S6 segments of domains I, III, and IV. The binding site may be approached from two pathways: from the intracellular aspect of the channel pore (hydrophilic pathway) or laterally from within the lipid membrane (hydrophobic pathway). As the amount of administered local anesthetic increases, an increasing percentage of VG<sub>Na</sub> bind to local anesthetics, further inhibiting the inward Na<sup>+</sup> current. Subsequently, the rate of depolarization (in response to stimulation) is attenuated, inhibiting the achievement of the threshold membrane potential. Consequently, achievement of an action potential becomes increasingly difficult. With a sufficient number of local anesthetic-bound VG<sub>Na</sub>, an action potential can no longer be generated, and impulse propagation is blocked. Local anesthetic binding to VG<sub>Na</sub> does not alter the resting membrane potential nor does it alter the threshold potential.</p>
<p class="indent">Local anesthetics bind more avidly to VG<sub>Na</sub> in the activated (open) and inactivated (channel pore is <strong><em>open</em></strong> but closed by movement of the inactivation gate) conformations. The difference in binding affinity is attributable to the difference in the availability of the two pathways for local anesthetic to reach the binding site. Local anesthetics produce a concentration-dependent decrease in inward Na<sup>+</sup> current characterized as <strong><em>tonic blockade</em></strong>, representing a decrease in the number of open confirmation VG<sub>Na</sub>.<sup><a href="ch012-sec06.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> When undergoing repeated depolarization, a greater number of VG<sub>Na</sub> are in either the activated or inactivated conformations with high binding affinity for local anesthetics. Thus, repeated stimulation results in accumulation of local anesthetic-bound VG<sub>Na</sub> characterized as <strong><em>frequency (or use)-dependent blockade</em></strong>.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Not only do local anesthetics prevent nerve impulse propagation by adhering to binding sites on voltage-gated sodium channels in the cell membrane (tonic blockade), they also bind more readily to nerves undergoing repeated stimulation (frequency [or use]-dependent blockade).</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen176">D. Mechanisms of Nerve Block</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In order for local anesthetics to bind VG<sub>Na</sub>, they must reach the neural membrane. Thus, local anesthetics must penetrate through variable amounts of perineural tissue and still maintain a sufficient concentration gradient to diffuse through the lipid bilayer. Only a small fraction (1%-2%) of local anesthetic reaches the neural membrane even when deposited in close proximity to peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves that have been desheathed in vitro require about a 100-fold lower local anesthetic concentration than peripheral nerves in vivo. In contrast, central neuraxial nerves are encased in three layers of meninges: the pia mater, arachnoid membrane, and dura mater. The pia mater is adherent to the nerves themselves and is separated from the arachnoid membrane by cerebrospinal fluid that fills the space between these two layers. The <strong><em>subarachnoid</em></strong> space, where the spinal nerves are only covered by the pia mater, is the target location for spinal anesthesia. The dura mater further encases the arachnoid membrane, forming the dural sac, a tough covering around the central neuraxis. The epidural space consists of everything located within the vertebral canal but outside the dural sac. The presence of the arachnoid membrane and dura mater result in 10-fold higher local anesthetic dose requirements to produce complete epidural blockade compared with that required in the subarachnoid space.</p>
<p class="indent">The quality of nerve block is determined not only by the intrinsic potency of the chosen local anesthetic but also by the concentration and volume of the administered local anesthetic. The potency of a local anesthetic can be<a id="page246"></a> expressed as the minimum effective concentration required to establish complete nerve blockade. The volume of local anesthetic is also important, as a sufficient length of axon or adjacent nodes of Ranvier must be blocked in order to inhibit regeneration of the neural impulse. This is due to the phenomenon of <strong><em>decremental conduction</em></strong>. Membrane depolarization passively decays with distance away from the front of the action potential to the point that impulse propagation stops when depolarization falls below the threshold for VG<sub>Na</sub> activation. If less than a critical length of axon is blocked, the action potential may still be regenerated in the proximal neural membrane segment or node of Ranvier when the decaying depolarization is still above the threshold potential for Na<sup>+</sup> channel activation.</p>

<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Differential blockade refers to the predictable progression of sensory and motor function blockade by local anesthetics, starting with loss of temperature sensation and followed by impaired proprioception, motor function, sharp pain, and lastly light touch.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Different types of nerve fibers demonstrate varying minimal blocking concentrations and local anesthetic susceptibilities (<strong><a href="#tt12-1">Table 12.1</a></strong>). Clinically, there is a predictable progression of sensory and motor function blockade, starting first with loss of temperature sensation, followed by proprioception, motor function, sharp pain, and lastly light touch. Termed <strong><em>differential block</em></strong>, this progression was initially attributed to differences in axon diameter, with smaller fibers inherently more susceptible to conduction blockade compared with that of larger fibers. However, small myelinated fibers (A&#x03B3; and A&#x03B4;) are the most susceptible to conduction blockade. Next in order of block susceptibility are large myelinated fibers (A&#x03B1; and A&#x03B2;), and the least susceptible are small, nonmyelinated C fibers.</p>
<p class="indent">Within peripheral nerves, longitudinal and radial diffusion of local anesthetic will produce varying drug concentrations along and within the nerve during the onset and recovery from clinical block. When local anesthetics are deposited around a peripheral nerve, diffusion progresses from the outer surface (mantle) toward the center (core) along a concentration gradient. Consequently, nerve fibers arranged in the mantle of mixed peripheral nerves are blocked initially. These outer nerve fibers are typically distributed to more proximal anatomic structures, whereas core fibers innervate more distal structures. This topographical arrangement explains the initial development of proximal, followed by distal anesthesia, as local anesthetic diffuses to the more centrally located core nerve fibers. In summary, the sequence of onset and recovery from peripheral nerve block depends on a combination of the topographical arrangement of the nerve fibers within a mixed peripheral nerve and their inherent susceptibility to local anesthetic blockade.</p>
