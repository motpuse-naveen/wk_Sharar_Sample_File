<h4 class="h4" id="sec40">III. Hepatic Blood Supply</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The liver receives 25% of the total cardiac output, accounts for 20% of resting oxygen consumption, and together with the splanchnic vascular bed contains 10% to 15% of the total blood volume. The liver&#x2019;s dual blood supply consists of 75% portal blood (deoxygenated blood) and 25% hepatic arterial blood (oxygenated blood). Although portal blood is deoxygenated, its higher flow results in equivalent oxygen delivery to the hepatic artery. The valveless <strong><em>portal vein</em></strong> acts as a capacitance vessel, while the <strong><em>hepatic artery</em></strong> is a resistance vessel that is dependent on systemic arterial pressure and flow. Most blood enters the hepatic sinusoids from portal venules through inlet sphincters, although branches of hepatic arterioles also terminate in sinusoids near the portal venules (arteriosinus twigs).</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Liver Blood Volume</strong></p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Due to its high blood flow (25% of cardiac output) and immense blood filtration capacity, the liver produces up to 50% of all lymph volume flowing in the thoracic duct.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">If portal flow decreases, arterial blood supply can be upregulated by vasodilatory molecules such as adenosine and nitric oxide. These mechanisms are not affected by either autonomic innervation or systemic humoral factors. The liver produces a significant volume of lymph through direct exudation from hepatic arterioles and constitutes 25% to 50% of the total lymph flow through the thoracic duct.</p>
<p class="indent">The spongy nature of the liver, combined with the contractile potential of stellate cells, allows this organ to function as an autologous reservoir that can augment blood volume in hypovolemic states and can store blood in hypervolemic states. This latter phenomenon can be observed in conditions of right heart failure (congestive hepatopathy), hypervolemia (renal failure), and iatrogenic overresuscitation (<strong><a href="#ff6-5">Figures 6.5</a></strong> and <strong><a href="ch006-sec04.xhtml#ff6-6">6.6</a></strong>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen86">A. Hepatic Autonomic System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">While liver transplant recipients live well with a completely denervated donor organ, elevated rates of diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity may underscore the effects of hepatic innervation. Food intake stimuli are modified through vagal sensing of portal vein glucose and lipid levels; insulin sensitivity and skeletal muscle glucose uptake are influenced by autonomic control of hepatic insulin sensitizing substance; hepatic glycogen storage is equally affected by autonomic control. Serum osmolality sensing in the sinusoidal system triggers a hepatorenal reflex with modulation of Na+ retention. Sinusoidal blood flow is affected by sympathetic effects on the hepatic artery and hepatic nerve efferent control of sinusoidal contraction. The biliary tree is densely innervated by parasympathetic nerve branches, with some nerve endings actually reaching the ductal lumen.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen87">B. Lymphatic System</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The liver produces a large volume of lymph amounting to 25% to 50% of volume transported in the thoracic duct. Lymphatic vessels are associated to three categories according to location: portal, sublobular, and capsular. The collected fluid contains approximately 80% of proteins measured in plasma. Bile constituents are found in hepatic lymph during biliary obstruction. Lymph vessels are primarily present along the portal vasculature, the hepatic artery, and the bile ducts. These valved capillaries increase in complexity from single-cell, permeable capillaries without basement membranes to larger collecting vessels with lower permeability. Most hepatic lymph appears to be derived from hepatic sinusoids or hepatic vasculature. The liver capsule has no intrinsic blood supply, but the organ surface is only separated from the parenchyma by<a id="page121"></a> a single-cell layer suggesting a sinusoidal origin of capsular lymph. Lymphatic vessels combine to 12 to 15 vessels running along hepatic arteries and the bile duct and are bundled in multiple, regional lymph nodes (<strong><a href="ch006-sec04.xhtml#ff6-7">Figures 6.7</a></strong> and <strong><a href="ch006-sec04.xhtml#ff6-8">6.8</a></strong>).</p>

Schematic depiction of the blood-bile barrier (BBlB) in the liver. The BBlB is composed of mainly tight junctions present at the apical membrane domain of the hepatocytes, which restricts the mixing of sinusoidal blood and bile.
