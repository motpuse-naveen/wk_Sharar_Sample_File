<h4 class="h4" id="sec63">I. History and Introduction</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The introduction of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) into clinical medicine (curare in 1942 and succinylcholine in 1949) has facilitated major advances in anesthesiology. NMBAs are primarily used to facilitate intubation and to improve operating conditions. They may also be used in surgical cases where prevention of any patient movement is critical. NMBAs are also used on specific indication in the intensive care unit, particularly to facilitate mechanical ventilation. Despite their many benefits, NMBAs carry their own set of complications. This class of drugs contributes to the risk of accidental awareness under anesthesia, a rare but serious complication that often leads to devastating posttraumatic stress disorder. A more common complication is a clinically significant lingering effect after emergence from anesthesia. This is referred to as postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade, or residual paralysis; 30% to 40% of patients who receive NMBAs are at risk for this complication. Given that there are over 200 million major surgeries performed every year worldwide, the number of patients exposed to potential complications is significant, and appropriate neuromuscular blockade monitoring is a major patient safety issue. Allergic reactions and anaphylaxis (with an incidence of 1 in 6000-20,000 administrations depending on NMBA), although rare, are also potential problems.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen145">A. Morphology of the Neuromuscular Junction</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Muscle contraction occurs when a signal transmitted from the brain via nerve fibers is received by the muscle. A nerve is made up of many axons, and those axons communicate with muscle fibers. The motor unit consists of the motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates. Strength of muscle contraction is tied to the number of motor units activated, such that the activation of more motor units leads to a stronger muscle contraction.</p>
<p class="indent">The transmission of the nerve signal to the muscle occurs at the neuromuscular junction (<strong><a href="#ff11-1">Figure 11.1</a></strong>). This consists of the end of the motor nerve (presynaptic motor neuron), a gap (synaptic cleft, 50&#x00A0;nm width), and the muscle fiber (motor end plate). Acetylcholine (ACh) is the transmitter utilized to traverse the synaptic cleft, and within the cleft resides the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChAse) to keep the process in check. The release of ACh is tightly regulated at the presynaptic nerve. There are folds on the muscle which contain muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). More than 90% of all nAChRs in a muscle fiber are located at the synapse, an area that<a id="page212"></a> represents &#x003C;0.1% of the total muscle membrane surface area.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> This elegant process strings together electrical (motor nerve end), chemical (ACh release), and mechanical (muscle contractions) events.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen146">B. Presynaptic Events: Mobilization and Release of Acetylcholine</h5>
<p class="nonindent">An electrical signal reaching the presynaptic motor neuron ending, the nerve terminal, activates voltage-gated calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) channels allowing the influx of calcium. ACh is synthesized in the presynaptic nerve terminal from choline and acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase. The calcium influx mobilizes small vesicles containing ACh to migrate toward the synaptic cleft, fuse with the nerve membrane, and release quanta (50,000-100,000 molecules) of ACh into the synaptic cleft. Some ACh-containing vesicles reside in the active zone very near the membrane, where they are immediately available for fusion. A much larger number or ACh vesicles reside away from the active zone in a reserve pool. Proteins present in the nerve terminal facilitate vesicle movement from the reserve pool to the active zone. Release of ACh from vesicles also occur spontaneously and randomly, leading to miniature end plate potentials (MEPPs) which represent release of hundreds of ACh molecules. In contrast, an action potential initiates a coordinated fusion of thousands of ACh vesicles releasing millions of ACh into the synaptic cleft.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The ACh vesicle transport system cannot keep up when exogenous electrical signals are sent to a nerve at very high frequencies (typically above 70&#x00A0;Hz). When 100&#x00A0;Hz stimulation is applied over 5 seconds, muscle contraction often cannot be sustained. This is known as physiologic fade.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">ACh vesicle migration and fusion are hindered if there is insufficient calcium available (hypocalcemia). In high concentrations, magnesium can bind and block the calcium channel, limiting calcium influx and ACh vesicle release leading to weakness. This is seen in women receiving magnesium infusions to slow the progress of labor. In Eaton-Lambert syndrome,<a id="page213"></a> antibodies target the calcium channels, again hindering calcium influx and resulting in weakness.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The migration of ACh vesicles is accomplished by a group of proteins that are digested by botulinum toxin, impairing release of ACh and leading to weakness.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen147">C. Postsynaptic Events</h5>
<p class="nonindent">ACh traverses the synaptic cleft to the motor end plate of the muscle where it binds to postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (muscle-type nAChR) which are made up of five subunits. If sufficient ACh is released, depolarization of the muscle membrane occurs, resulting in actin-myosin&#x2013;mediated muscle contraction. Two types of nAChR exist, mature and immature, which have four subunits in common (alpha, alpha, beta, delta). Mature nAChR, which only reside at the muscle endplate, contains an epsilon subunit (think &#x201C;&#x03B5;&#x201D; as an E in elderly). The immature nAChR is predominately extrajunctional and contains gamma as the fifth subunit. ACh must bind to both &#x03B1; subunits (think two &#x201C;launch keys&#x201D; are required) of the nAChRs to induce a conformational change of the receptor that results in the formation of a central channel (pore). The central channel allows sodium ion (Na<sup>+</sup>) influx and potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) efflux, resulting in muscle cell membrane depolarization (resting &#x2212;90&#x00A0;mV to positive). Voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels on the muscle membrane propagate the action potential across the membrane, leading to the development of muscle tension (excitation-contraction coupling). Upon release from the receptor, ACh undergoes rapid and efficient hydrolysis by AChAse into choline and acetic acid. Choline is then reabsorbed into the presynaptic nerve terminal. ACh can also bind to presynaptic neuronal nAChRs, which facilitates ACh movement from the reserve pool to the active zone, thus providing positive feedback allowing for an adequate concentration of ACh in the active zone also for repetitive muscle activity.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen148">D. Receptor Up- and Downregulation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Upper or lower motor neuron disruption, severe burns, immobilization, sepsis, prolonged use of NMBAs in the intensive care unit, or cerebrovascular accidents, all decrease the frequency of motor nerve stimulations. When these conditions persist over days, the number of immature nAChRs increases (upregulation). The immature nAChRs have increased sensitivity to agonists (ACh and succinylcholine [SCh]) and decreased sensitivity to nondepolarizing NMBAs. The channel opening time of the immature nAChRs is up to tenfold longer and may allow systemic release of lethal doses of intracellular K<sup>+</sup> in response to administration of SCh. Downregulation of mature nAChRs occurs during periods of sustained agonist stimulation, for instance, chronic neostigmine use (in patients with myasthenia gravis), or organophosphorus poisoning. This leads to SCh resistance and extreme sensitivity to nondepolarizing NMBAs.</p>
