<p class="nonindent">Anesthesiology as a medical specialty developed gradually in the United States during the 20th century. For decades after Morton&#x2019;s demonstration, there was no formal instruction in anesthesia. In the first part of the 20th century, Ralph Waters advocated for dedicated anesthesia departments and training programs. Later, anesthesiologists such as Thomas D. Buchanan and John Lundy established formal anesthesia departments in the New York Medical College and the Mayo Clinic, respectively, and Waters at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison established the first anesthesiology postgraduate training program in 1927.</p>
