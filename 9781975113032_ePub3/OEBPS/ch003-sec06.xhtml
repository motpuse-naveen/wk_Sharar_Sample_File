<h5 class="h5" id="sen45">A. Left Ventricular Pump</h5>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">In isolated cardiac muscle, contractile tension increases with stimulation frequency to a maximum of 150 to 180 contractions per second (Bowditch effect). However, such high heart rates reduce diastolic filling time in the intact heart and are only seen in special settings (dysrhythmias, strenuous exercise).</p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent">Each ventricle essentially operates as a hydraulic pump whose performance is defined by its ability to collect blood (diastolic function) and eject blood (systolic function), which is determined by the factors summarized in <strong><a href="#ff3-10">Figure 3.10</a></strong>. The key determinants of systolic function are the blood volume ejected (<strong><em>stroke volume</em></strong>), the volume efficiency of blood ejection (<strong><em>ejection fraction</em></strong>), the pumping frequency (<strong><em>heart rate</em></strong>), the volume of blood filling the pump (<strong><em>preload</em></strong>), the downstream resistance the ejected blood must overcome (<strong><em>afterload</em></strong>), and the contractile ability of the ventricle (<strong><em>myocardial contractility</em></strong>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen46">B. Cardiac Output and Ejection Fraction</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The performance of the LV is practically measured as the <strong><em>cardiac output</em> (<em>CO</em>)</strong>, defined as the stroke volume (SV) times the heart rate (HR). The SV is the difference between the <strong><em>end-diastolic volume</em></strong> (EDV) and <strong><em>end-systolic volume</em></strong> (ESV). As shown in <strong><a href="ch003-sec05.xhtml#ff3-8">Figure 3.8</a></strong>, a normal EDV of &#x223C;120&#x00A0;mL and ESV of &#x223C;40&#x00A0;mL would yield<a id="page53"></a> a SV of &#x223C;80&#x00A0;mL. The normal LV ejection fraction (SV/EDV) is therefore 67%. Thus, pump efficiency is impaired (ie, low ejection fraction) in settings such as a dilated LV with elevated EDV and normal SV (eg, dilated cardiomyopathy) or a normal-sized LV with poor contractility and low SV (eg, myocardial infarction).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff3-9"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff3-9.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="caption"><span class="fignum">Figure&#160;3.9</span> These schematic illustrations demonstrate alterations in the steady state left ventricular (LV) pressure-volume diagram produced by a reduction in myocardial contractility as indicated by a decrease in the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation (ESPVR; <em>left</em>) and a decrease in LV compliance as indicated by an increase in the position of the end-diastolic pressure-volume relation (EDPVR; <em>right</em>). These diagrams emphasize that heart failure may result from LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction independently.

<h5 class="h5" id="sen47">C. Heart Rate</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In the isolated cardiac muscle, contractile tension increases with stimulation frequency due to an increase in intracellular calcium content. This effect is known as the Bowditch or staircase phenomenon and results in maximal<a id="page54"></a> contractile tension at frequencies of 150 to 180 contractions per second. In the intact heart, however, such high heart rates do not allow for adequate diastolic filling time to achieve optimal EDV and therefore result in insufficient SV to maintain meaningful CO. Thus, the Bowditch effect is of little physiologic consequence in the normal physiologic heart rate range of 50 to 150 beats per minute. The exception is with clinical settings where LV filling is impaired due to extrinsic compression (eg, constrictive pericarditis, pericardial tamponade), where elevated heart rates may augment contractility and preserve systemic perfusion. Furthermore, pathologic heart rates exceeding 150 beats per minute typically result in profound hypotension and cardiovascular collapse.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen48">D. Preload</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In the isolated cardiac muscle, preload refers to the sarcomere length immediately prior to contraction. Applying force (preload) to the resting muscle stretches the muscle to the desired length and results in increases in resting tension, initial velocity of contraction, and peak contractile tension. This relation between preload (resting myocardial length) and contractile performance is termed the <strong><em>Frank-Starling relationship</em></strong>. In the intact ventricle, this relation is between preload (EDV) and systolic ventricular pressure and SV, both of which influence cardiac output (SV &#x00D7; heart rate [HR]) and ventricular stroke work (SV &#x00D7; mean arterial pressure [MAP]).</p>
<p class="indent">Because EDV influences both systolic pressure and SV, preload is an important determinant of cardiac output and is moderated by circulating blood volume, venous tone, and posture. Furthermore, when afterload is held constant, the effects of preload on SV and cardiac output are strongly influenced by ventricular performance. For example, the failing LV is less preload sensitive than the normal LV; as a result, increases in EDV produce a lesser response in SV, resulting in pulmonary congestion, for example, during an exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF). Conversely, when contractility is enhanced by circulating or endogenous catecholamines, the LV is more preload sensitive, with increases in EDV leading to an amplified SV response. Preload is most reliably assessed by echocardiographic measurement of EDV.<sup><a href="ch003-sec10.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> In clinical practice, however, a variety of surrogates for EDV may also be considered indicators of preload, each of which can potentially be affected by specific anatomic and physiologic conditions that can introduce inaccuracies in preload assessment (<strong><a href="#ff3-11">Figure 3.11</a></strong>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen49">E. Afterload</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Afterload refers to the tension placed on myocardial fibers during systole and is the force that the ventricle must overcome to eject its SV. The concept of afterload can seem nebulous in the clinical setting, as it is challenging to measure and reflects different physiologic processes in the LV and the RV. LV afterload is determined by multiple factors including the size and mechanical behavior of large arterial conduits (eg, atherosclerosis) and the aortic valve (eg, stenosis), terminal arteriolar impedance (eg, hypoxia-induced vasodilation, varying autonomic tone), and LV wall stress. RV afterload is determined by the size and mechanical behavior of large pulmonary arteries (eg, pulmonary embolism) and the pulmonic valve (eg, stenosis), pulmonary arteriolar impedance (hypoxia- and hypercarbia-induced vasoconstriction), and RV wall stress.</p>
<p class="indent">The important relation between ventricular volume, wall stress, and myocardial work is based on the balance of opposing forces that help maintain a spherical shell at a certain size, which is described by <strong><em>Laplace law</em></strong> (<strong><a href="#ff3-12">Figure 3.12</a></strong>). As an idealized spherical shell, the LV maintains any given size due to the balance between ventricular pressure (acting to enlarge the LV) and wall stress (acting to<a id="page55"></a> resist LV enlargement). Laplace&#x2019;s law relates LV pressure (<em>p</em>) and wall stress (&#x03C3;) in the equation [<em>p</em>&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;(2&#x00A0;*&#x00A0;&#x03C3;&#x00A0;*&#x00A0;<em>h</em>)/<em>r</em>], where <em>r</em> is the sphere&#x2019;s radius and <em>h</em> is the LV wall thickness. Thus, increases in either LV pressure (eg, essential hypertension) or LV size (eg, chronic mitral insufficiency) result in increased wall stress and increased afterload. In order for myocardial cells to generate greater tension and wall stress in these settings, greater energy expenditure is required, thereby increasing both myocardial oxygen consumption and the risk of myocardial ischemia.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Law of Laplace</strong></p>
<p class="indent">As with preload, changes in afterload can significantly influence SV and therefore cardiac output, particularly when ventricular performance is<a id="page56"></a> abnormal. For example, the failing LV with reduced contractility is more afterload sensitive than the healthy LV and will demonstrate a proportionately greater decrease in cardiac output when afterload is increased (<strong><a href="#ff3-13">Figure 3.13</a></strong>).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff3-12"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff3-12.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="caption"><span class="fignum">Figure&#160;3.12</span> This schematic diagram depicts the opposing forces within a theoretical left ventricular (LV) sphere that determines Laplace law.

<div class="figure" id="ff3-13"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff3-13.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="caption"><span class="fignum">Figure&#160;3.13</span> The effects of increasing afterload (systemic vascular resistance) on ventricular performance (cardiac output) are shown for three different states of contractility. Under normal conditions, increases in afterload reduce left ventricle (LV) performance. However, the failing LV is more afterload sensitive than the healthy LV; thus, a greater decrease in cardiac output occurs as myocardial contractility is progressively impaired.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">As with preload, direct measurement of afterload in the clinical setting is challenging. The most common surrogate assessment of afterload is the calculation of vascular resistance using measurements of cardiac output and pressure changes across either the pulmonary vasculature (<strong><em>pulmonary vascular resistance</em></strong> [PVR]) or the systemic vasculature (<strong><em>systemic vascular resistance</em></strong> [SVR]). PVR is calculated as the difference between mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) and LA pressure or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) divided by the cardiac output. SVR on the other hand is calculated as the difference between the mean aortic pressure (MAP) and RA pressure or central venous pressure (CVP), divided by the cardiac output. It is important to understand that the PVR and SVR are only estimates of RV and LV afterload, respectively.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen50">F. Myocardial Contractility</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Myocardial contractility is an intrinsic property of cardiac muscle. It refers to the force and velocity of muscular contraction of the ventricle under conditions of load and represents the systolic myocardial work done for a given preload and afterload. Also termed the inotropic state, contractility can be influenced by a number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that increase inotropy (autonomic SNS activity, endogenous catecholamines, exogenous catecholamines, calcium, digitalis) or decrease inotropy (autonomic PNS activity,<a id="page57"></a> myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, hypercarbia, cardiomyopathy, hypocalcemia, &#x03B2;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic blocking drugs).</p>

The LV endocardial border surrounding the black LV chamber is manually traced (excluding the papillary muscles), and the inscribed area is calculated by integrating software. The LV ejection fraction is determined as the difference between the end-diastolic area and the end-systolic area, divided by the end-diastolic area.

<p class="indent">Contractility is difficult to measure in vivo because the strength of cardiac contraction is also determined by preload and afterload. As noted earlier, the maximum rate of rise in LV pressure (+dP/dt) that occurs during the brief isovolumic contraction period is one useful indirect index of LV contractility, in part because it is largely afterload independent. In contrast, the Frank-Starling relationship dictates that&#x00A0;+dP/dt is highly dependent on preload. LV pressure (and hence&#x00A0;+dP/dt) can only be directly measured invasively during cardiac catheterization but can be estimated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The two most practical surrogate assessments of contractility by TEE are the ejection fraction (<strong><a href="#ff3-14">Figure 3.14</a></strong>) and P-V diagram analysis of the ESPVR (<strong><a href="ch003-sec05.xhtml#ff3-8">Figures 3.8</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#ff3-9">3.9</a></strong>).</p>
