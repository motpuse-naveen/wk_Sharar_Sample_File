<h5 class="h5" id="sen277">A. Adrenal Cortex</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The adrenal gland is composed of two parts: the outer cortex and the inner medulla. The cortex is divided into three zones&#x2014;the <strong><em>zona glomerulosa</em></strong>, <strong><em>zona fasciculata</em></strong>, and <strong><em>zona reticularis</em></strong>&#x2014;which produce <strong><em>mineralocorticoids</em></strong>, <a id="page387"></a><strong><em>glucocorticoids</em></strong>, and <strong><em>androgens</em></strong>, respectively (<strong><a href="#ff18-4">Figure 18.4</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch018-sec07.xhtml#bib4">4</a>-<a href="ch018-sec07.xhtml#bib6">6</a></sup> The precursor of all steroid hormones is cholesterol, which is converted to pregnenolone in the mitochondria. Pregnenolone is transported to the cytoplasm and then converted by various enzymes into specific steroid hormones. The signs and symptoms of abnormal adrenal cortical function are typically the result of cortisol or aldosterone excess or deficiency.</p>

<h6 class="h6">1. Physiologic Effects of Glucocorticoids</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Glucocorticoid production and secretion is controlled by <strong><em>corticotropin</em></strong> (adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH) from the pituitary gland. Glucocorticoids increase protein catabolism, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis and have anti-inflammatory and anti-insulin effects. They are required for glucagon and catecholamines to have their metabolic effects, as well as for normal vascular reactivity, neurologic function, and water excretion.<sup><a href="ch018-sec07.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup></p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Cushing Syndrome</strong></p>
<h6 class="h6">2. Glucocorticoid Excess (Cushing Syndrome)</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Glucocorticoid excess leads to <strong><em>Cushing syndrome</em></strong>. This excess can be due to either an increase in ACTH (ACTH-dependent) or increased production by the adrenal gland (ACTH-independent). <strong><em>Cushing disease</em></strong> is a specific term used to describe glucocorticoid excess resulting from ACTH-secreting tumors in the anterior pituitary. Ectopic ACTH produced by other tumors (eg, the lung) leads to Cushing syndrome. Causes of ACTH-independent glucocorticoid excess include glucocorticoid-secreting tumors of the adrenal gland, hyperplasia of the adrenal gland, or prolonged exogenous administration of glucocorticoids. As expected, because of the catabolic effects of glucocorticoids, patients with Cushing syndrome have significant glucose intolerance and develop diabetes mellitus and proximal muscle atrophy. They retain water and often become hypertensive. Other complications include osteoporosis, truncal obesity, and emotional lability. Anesthetic implications for patients with Cushing syndrome undergoing an adrenalectomy are detailed in <strong><a href="#tt18-7">Table 18.7</a></strong>.</p>
<h6 class="h6">3. Adrenal Insufficiency (Addison Disease)</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Adrenal deficiency can occur because of primary adrenal failure or lack of sufficient corticotropin from the pituitary gland (secondary). Patients may present with nonspecific symptoms (chronic fatigue, muscle weakness, anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). <strong><em>Chronic adrenal insufficiency</em></strong> is diagnosed by determining the plasma cortisol response to a corticotropin stimulation test. <strong><em>Addison disease</em></strong> is treated with daily exogenous glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. <strong><em>Acute adrenal insufficiency (Addisonian crisis)</em></strong> frequently presents with hypotension, decreased consciousness, and shock and requires intravenous hydrocortisone. Perioperative implications for patients with Addisonian crisis are detailed in <strong><a href="#tt18-8">Table 18.8</a></strong>.</p>

<h6 class="h6">4. Exogenous Glucocorticoid Therapy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Anesthesiologists should be familiar with the different preparations of synthetic steroids that are used therapeutically (<strong><a href="#tt18-9">Table 18.9</a></strong>). Dexamethasone, betamethasone, and triamcinolone have no mineralocorticoid activity and are typically used for their anti-inflammatory properties. Fludrocortisone has 12 times more mineralocorticoid activity than anti-inflammatory activity and is used to supplement mineralocorticoid activity in adrenal deficiency. Cortisol (hydrocortisone) and cortisone have equal mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid activity. Prednisone and methylprednisone are typically used for immunologic and inflammatory diseases.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The normal daily production of cortisol is 10 to 20&#x00A0;mg/d but can reach 200 to 500&#x00A0;mg/d under periods of extreme stress (trauma).</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">5. Steroid Replacement During the Perioperative Period</h6>
<p class="nonindent">One of the major consequences of administering exogenous steroids is suppression of the <strong><em>hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA)</em></strong>.<sup><a href="ch018-sec07.xhtml#bib2">2</a>,<a href="ch018-sec07.xhtml#bib4">4</a>,<a href="ch018-sec07.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup> Suppression of the HPA is unlikely to develop in a patient who has received &#x003C;1&#x00A0;week of lower-dose exogenous steroid therapy. Patients who receive &#x003E;3&#x00A0;weeks of steroid therapy can be considered to have a suppressed HPA, especially if they are consuming more than 20&#x00A0;mg/d of prednisone (or equivalent doses of other steroids). It can take up to 6 to 9&#x00A0;months for the HPA to normalize. If patients do not receive steroid supplementation in the perioperative period, they can present in Addisonian crisis. Patients who receive &#x2264;5&#x00A0;mg/d of prednisolone usually do not require additional supplementation if they have taken their usual morning dose prior to surgery. Perioperative supplementation of steroids is based on expected physiologic stress induced by surgery.<sup><a href="ch018-sec07.xhtml#bib8">8</a>,<a href="ch018-sec07.xhtml#bib9">9</a></sup> For high-risk surgeries, usual daily dose plus hydrocortisone 100 mg IV before incision followed by continuous IV infusion of 200 mg of hydrocortisone in 24 hours, is recommended, while for moderate to low-risk surgeries, 50&#x00A0;mg at induction, followed by 25 mg every 8 hours &#x00A0;in the next 24 hours, may be sufficient (<strong><a href="#tt18-10">Table 18.10</a></strong>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">6. Physiological Effects of Mineralocorticoids</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Aldosterone</em></strong> is the predominant and most potent mineralocorticoid produced by the adrenal gland. Its release is controlled by <strong><em>angiotensin II</em></strong>, ACTH, and serum potassium (<strong>Figure</strong> <strong>18.5</strong>). Aldosterone is responsible for sodium and water absorption from the kidney to maintain adequate intravascular volume. Decreased intravascular volume leads to a decrease in afferent arteriolar<a id="page390"></a> pressure in the nephron. This is sensed by the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which secretes renin. <strong><em>Renin</em></strong> converts circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is further converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme in the lungs. Angiotensin II is a potent stimulus for aldosterone secretion. Aldosterone acts on the distal renal tubules and promotes sodium and water absorption, which leads to restitution of intravascular volume. Sodium is exchanged for potassium or hydrogen ions in the distal tubules.</p>

<h6 class="h6">7. Mineralocorticoid Excess</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) excess leads to sodium absorption and potassium or hydrogen ion excretion in the renal tubules. This causes hypertension, muscle weakness (due to contractile dysfunction of skeletal muscle), polyuria, tetany, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Aldosterone excess can be broadly classified as primary or secondary hyperaldosteronism. In primary hyperaldosteronism, high levels of aldosterone are caused by increased production by the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone excess can be a result of primary adrenal disease (<strong><em>Conn syndrome</em></strong>), adrenal hyperplasia, adrenal adenoma or carcinoma, or a genetic disorder involving corticotropin. In primary hyperaldosteronism, renin activity is depressed and patients rarely exhibit edema. In secondary hyperaldosteronism, which is commonly seen in heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephrosis, aldosterone excess is caused by increased renin levels. In these conditions, the kidneys sense a low intravascular volume, which triggers<a id="page391"></a> renin release and ultimately leads to increased angiotensin II production and aldosterone secretion. Patients retain sodium and water to compensate for low intravascular volume and develop significant edema (<strong><a href="#tt18-11">Table 18.11</a></strong>).</p>

<p class="dify">Only the brain and adrenal gland have the specific enzyme phenylethanolamine <em>N</em>-methyltransferase, which can convert norepinephrine to epinephrine.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen278">B. Adrenal Medulla</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The adrenal medulla predominantly produces <strong><em>epinephrine</em></strong> and small amounts of <strong><em>norepinephrine and dopamine</em></strong>. All three catecholamines are derived from the amino acid tyrosine. Adrenal phenylethanolamine <em>N</em>-methyltransferase is the enzyme responsible for conversion of norepinephrine to epinephrine. This enzyme is induced by glucocorticoids; thus, glucocorticoids are intricately involved in catecholamine production and function. Epinephrine and norepinephrine levels are significantly increased during and after surgery (<strong><a href="#ff18-6">Figure 18.6</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch018-sec07.xhtml#bib10">10</a></sup> Catecholamines have a very short half-life (2 minutes) and are metabolized to <strong><em>vanillylmandelic acid</em></strong>, metanephrines, or normetanephrine and excreted in the urine (<strong><a href="#ff18-7">Figure 18.7</a></strong>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">1. Pheochromocytoma</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that produces catecholamines&#x2014;mainly norepinephrine. Patients present with sustained or <a id="page392"></a>paroxysmal hypertension. Because of enhanced vasoconstriction, patients are significantly volume depleted. Diagnosis is established by measuring free catecholamines and vanillylmandelic acid in a 24-hour urine collection. Most pheochromocytomas are solitary adenomas and require surgical resection. Patients with pheochromocytoma are managed medically before elective surgery. The basic objective of medical management is to blunt hyperadrenergic symptoms. Initially, <strong><em>alpha-blockers</em></strong> are used (phenoxybenzamine, &#x03B1;<sub>1</sub> antagonists) followed by <strong><em>beta-blockers</em></strong> (labetalol, metoprolol). Beta-blockers should be used in conjunction with alpha-blockers, as predominant beta-blockade can lead to an unopposed alpha effect that may worsen hypertension.<sup><a href="ch018-sec07.xhtml#bib11">11</a></sup> Surgery is usually curative. &#x0391;lpha-methyltyrosine is a drug that inhibits catecholamine production via inhibition of the tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme. It is most often used for patients with metastatic disease or in situations where surgery is contraindicated. Anesthetic implications for patients with pheochromocytoma are detailed in <strong><a href="ch018-sec05.xhtml#tt18-12">Table 18.12</a></strong>.</p>
