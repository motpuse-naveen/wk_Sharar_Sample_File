<h5 class="h5" id="sen163">A. Subjective Evaluation and Quantitative Monitoring</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Monitoring involves the stimulation of a peripheral nerve and evaluating the response (contraction or twitch) of the innervated muscle. Peripheral nerve stimulators (PNS) are generally battery-operated, stand-alone units that provide the stimulus via wires connected to surface (skin) electrodes. When a PNS is used, the response is evaluated subjectively either visually or manually (tactile assessment). Subjective evaluation has consequential limitations stemming from the inability of humans to detect subtle variations in movement. Quantitative monitors objectively measure the evoked muscle response. Importantly, these monitors provide real-time accurate measurements of the TOFR (see &#x201C;Pharmacologic Characteristics of Neuromuscular Blocking Agents for definition&#x201D;); there is expert consensus that best practice includes the routine use of quantitative monitoring of neuromuscular blockade.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup> PNS and quantitative monitors both stimulate a nerve (the ulnar nerve and the evoked response of the adductor pollicis muscle is the gold standard) in the same manner; the difference is in the assessment of the response. They deliver a range of currents up to 80&#x00A0;mA. The current should be constant (square wave) over the duration of the impulse. The most commonly used duration is 200 &#x00B5;s; it should not exceed 300 &#x00B5;s to avoid exceeding the nerve refractory period.</p>
<a id="page224"></a>
<p class="indent">The current is delivered via surface (skin) stimulating electrodes that have a silver-silver chloride interface with the skin, reducing its resistance. Standard electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes are acceptable, but specialized electrodes are also used. Skin can have very high resistance, and preparing the skin by cleaning with alcohol and abrading with a gauze is useful to improve delivery of the electrical stimulus.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen164">B. Monitoring Modalities</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The first nerve stimulators delivered single repetitive stimuli at frequencies between 0.1 and 10&#x00A0;Hz. The muscle response was a single twitch (ST) to each stimulus (<strong><a href="#ff11-6">Figure 11.6</a></strong>). If the frequency of stimulation exceeds 0.1&#x00A0;Hz (1 stimulus every 10 seconds) some degree of muscle fatigue may occur. To measure the extent of neuromuscular block, the current intensity is increased progressively (prior to NMBA administration) from 0&#x00A0;mA in 5 to 10&#x00A0;mA steps. The amplitude of the evoked muscle response is plotted over time and has a sigmoidal shape. Once the amplitude of the muscle response no longer increases despite increasing current intensity, the response is maximal, and the current required is called maximal current. Increasing the current value by 20% above maximal ensures that all fibers in the innervated muscle will consistently depolarize, despite skin resistance changes over time. This is termed supramaximal current. If a baseline control force is measured and recorded before NMBA administration, the force of subsequent contractions can be compared and expressed as twitch height (% of control). This modality (ST) is useful clinically to determine onset of neuromuscular block. Because the onset of neuromuscular block at the laryngeal muscles precedes the block at the adductor pollicis due to preferential blood flow to central musculature, satisfactory intubation conditions are often achieved before complete depression of the ST response at the adductor pollicis. The ST mode is not useful for monitoring of recovery from nondepolarizing block.</p>
<p class="indent">TOF stimulation was introduced clinically in 1971 and consists of four sequential ST stimuli (named T1, T2, T3, and T4) delivered at a frequency of 2&#x00A0;Hz (<strong><a href="#ff11-7">Figure 11.7A</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#ff11-7">B</a></strong>). Each train can be delivered every 15 to 20 seconds.<a id="page225"></a> The TOFR is calculated by dividing the T4 amplitude by the T1 amplitude. The control TOF response (before administration of NMBA) is four twitches of equal amplitude and the TOFR is 1.0 (100%). During a partial nondepolarizing block, the ratio decreases (ie, there is increasing fade) as the degree of block increases. A TOFR of 0.9 is considered acceptable clinical recovery, and residual paralysis is defined as a TOFR &#x003C;0.9 at the adductor pollicis. TOFR does not require a baseline measurement&#x2014;all subsequent responses are measured as a fraction of T1. By eliciting four responses, the clinician sometimes is able to assess the degree of fade subjectively by visual or tactile means or, more reliably, by counting the number of evoked responses (twitches) known as the train-of-four count (TOFC). When subjectively assessed, the TOFC has six possible classifications, namely 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 with fade, and 4 without fade. The term &#x201C;four out of four&#x201D; should be avoided as it conflates two distinct classifications. While it is possible to subjectively determine whether there is<a id="page226"></a> fade, or not, the precise TOFR is not possible to determine subjectively. Even experienced clinicians are unable to appreciate fade visually or manually when the TOFR exceeds approximately 0.4. Consequently, residual paralysis with a TOFR in the range 0.4 to 0.9 cannot be detected or ruled out by use of a PNS and subjective assessment. This is the most significant limitation of subjective monitoring, and the only way of overcoming this problem is through quantitative monitoring.</p>

B, Following TOF stimulation, depression of response to TOF (T4/T1&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;0.5) is noted following administration of a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">A supramaximal current is less important for TOF than for ST and the TOFR remains consistent over a range of stimulating currents, so it can be used to measure the degree of neuromuscular recovery in patients recovering from anesthesia. Currents of 30 to 40&#x00A0;mA are not associated with the high degree of discomfort and have been used extensively in research to assess TOFR in awake patients after anesthesia.</p>
<p class="indent">Tetanic stimulation (tetanus) describes repetitive stimulation at a frequency &#x003E;30&#x00A0;Hz. Below this threshold, repetitive nerve stimulations result in individual, rapid contractions. At frequencies above 30&#x00A0;Hz, the muscle responses become fused into a sustained contraction. The maximal voluntary muscle contraction is approximately 70&#x00A0;Hz, so frequencies above this level are supraphysiologic and may result in muscle contraction fade, even in the absence of NMBAs. Tetanus has been studied extensively for the duration of 5 seconds, so clinicians should always use a 5-second duration with tetanus. When tested during partial nondepolarizing block, the high frequency of tetanic stimulation will cause a temporary increase in the amount of ACh released so that subsequent responses will be increased transiently, a phenomenon known as posttetanic potentiation. Depending on the tetanic frequency, this period of potentiated responses may last 1 to 2 minutes after a 5-second, 50-Hz tetanus, or 3 minutes after a 5-second, 100-Hz tetanus. The response to stimulation during the period of posttetanic potentiation can be used to further define the depth of block when the TOFC is zero.</p>

<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Both visual and tactile (subjective) evaluation of fade to TOF stimulation fail to recognize significant degrees of residual block.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Posttetanic count (PTC), which is used during periods of deep block, consists of a 5-second, 50-Hz tetanic stimulus, followed by a 3-second pause and a series of 15 to 20 single twitches at a frequency of 1&#x00A0;Hz (<strong><a href="#ff11-8">Figure 11.8</a></strong>).<a id="page227"></a> The number of posttetanic twitches is inversely proportional to the depth of block: the fewer the number of posttetanic twitches, the deeper the block. With a PTC of 1, the time until recovery to a TOFC of 1 is about 20 to 30 minutes; however, recovery time may be significantly longer in some patients.</p>

The number of posttetanic twitches is inversely related to the degree of neuromuscular block.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Double burst stimulation was developed to increase the sensitivity when attempting to assess residual paralysis subjectively. By delivering two (instead of four) intense stimuli (minitetanic bursts) separated by 0.75 second, two fused responses can be evaluated directly instead of comparing the fourth response of the TOF to the first. This modality is termed double burst stimulation (DBS<sub>3,3</sub>) (<strong><a href="#ff11-9">Figure 11.9</a></strong>). The numbers 3,3 signify that each burst contains three stimuli at a frequency of 50&#x00A0;Hz. Because the two individual bursts are tetanic in frequency, a longer recovery period between successive DBS stimulations is necessary (20 seconds). Using DBS subjectively, clinicians are able to detect fade when the TOFR is &#x003C;0.60, an improvement over subjectively detected TOF fade. The inability to appreciate residual paralysis with TOFR in the range 0.6 to 0.9 is a significant shortcoming of DBS.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen165">C. Quantitative Monitoring</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There are different technologies for precise measurement of the evoked response. Mechanomyography (MMG) is considered the gold standard. It is an isometric measurement of the force of the thumb contraction. The equipment is cumbersome and not used in clinical practice.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">It is estimated that postoperative mortality is increased 90-fold if patients have residual paralysis that requires unplanned tracheal reintubation and intensive care postoperatively.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Electromyography (EMG) is one of the oldest methods of measuring neuromuscular transmission which yields measurements that do not differ significantly from MMG (<strong><a href="#ff11-10">Figure 11.10</a></strong>). For EMG monitoring, a peripheral nerve (usually the ulnar nerve) is stimulated via surface electrodes, and the action potential generated at the innervated muscle (adductor pollicis) is measured. Measurement of the evoked response involves either area under the curve of the compound muscle action potential, the peak-to-baseline, or the peak-to-peak amplitude of the signal.</p>
<p class="indent">Acceleromyography (AMG) has been the most commonly used clinical method of measuring muscle function in the past 3&#x00A0;decades (<strong><a href="#ff11-11">Figure 11.11</a></strong>). AMG consists of an accelerometer attached to a moving body part (usually the thumb) that measures the acceleration in response to nerve stimulation (the ulnar nerve and muscle contraction). Acceleration is directly proportional to force because force equals mass times acceleration. Although it is the most commonly used monitor, it has limitations. The thumb must be allowed to move freely throughout surgery, which usually prevents use of this type of monitor when surgical positioning includes tucking of the arms. Newer<a id="page229"></a> models employ triaxial vectoring, but keeping the arm and hand in a consistent position remains important for ideal monitor performance. Compared to MMG and EMG, AMG gives inflated values for TOFR; the baseline value before NMDA administration is often 1.1 to 1.15 but can be higher. The measurements provided by the AMG monitor are referred to as the raw values and there are two approaches to compensating for the inflated raw TOFR values. One can determine the individual baseline value before paralysis and divide all subsequent measurements by this value. This is called normalization to baseline value. As an example, if the baseline value is 1.12 and the postoperative TOFR is 0.94, the normalized TOFR will be 0.94/1.12&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;0.84. The alternative approach is to adjust the threshold for acceptable recovery to a raw value of 1.0. In this example, both approaches would lead to the raw value of TOFR&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;0.94 being classified as residual paralysis.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen166">D. Differential Muscle Sensitivity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">It has long been known that NMBAs do not affect all muscles at the same time nor do they produce the same depth of relaxation. It is also important to note that NMBAs are administered to produce good intubating conditions, vocal cord paralysis, abdominal muscle relaxation, or diaphragmatic immobility. Yet, laryngeal muscles, abdominal muscles, and the diaphragm are not monitored. Understanding the relation between the response of the different muscles to the effects or NMBAs is therefore clinically important.</p>
<p class="indent">The adductor pollicis is most commonly monitored (subjectively or objectively). Being a peripheral muscle, the onset time at the adductor pollicis is longer than in centrally located muscles, where blood flow (and thus drug delivery) is greater. At the same time, the adductor pollicis is more sensitive to nondepolarizing NMBAs, so recovery is delayed compared to central muscles (diaphragm, laryngeal muscles). Even monitoring of similar but different peripheral muscles innervated by a common nerve can induce error: stimulation of the ulnar nerve produces flexion of the fifth finger as well as adductor pollicis contraction. However, the recovery of the fifth finger contraction<a id="page230"></a> occurs more rapidly than at the adductor pollicis, so making a clinical decision based on recovery of the fifth finger will overestimate the degree of recovery.</p>
<p class="indent">For monitoring the adductor pollicis, stimulating electrodes are placed along the ulnar nerve on the volar surface of the forearm. The distal (negative) electrode is placed 2&#x00A0;cm proximal to the wrist crease, and the proximal (positive) electrode is placed along the ulnar nerve, 3 to 4&#x00A0;cm proximal to the negative electrode (<strong><a href="#ff11-12">Figure 11.12</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">When the patient&#x2019;s arms are not available for intraoperative monitoring, clinicians have monitored facial muscles: innervation of the facial nerve and evaluation of contractions of the eye muscles, either orbicularis oculi or the corrugator supercilii. However, this approach to monitoring is difficult and unreliable. First, the time course of recovery is not the same for the two eye muscles: the orbicularis oculi moves the eyelid and is more sensitive to NMDAs compared to the corrugator supercillii which raises the eyebrow. Second, improper placement of electrodes on the temple and lower jaw leads to direct muscle stimulation and false assessment of neuromuscular recovery. G&#x00E4;tke, in her detailed report on technical aspects of acceleromyographic monitoring of the orbicularis oculi, concluded: &#x201C;when monitoring in the face, with its many small nerves and muscles, it is difficult to ensure that only one single nerve is being stimulated and accordingly that only one muscle is contracting.&#x201D;<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup> Therefore, it may be quite difficult for anesthesia providers to distinguish between twitches of different muscles surrounding the eye. Third, although frequently used, the effectiveness of this approach to monitoring has not been validated. Fourth, current clinical practice of monitoring eye muscles has been shown to result in a fivefold increased risk of residual paralysis.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib9">9</a></sup> When the wrists and thumbs are unavailable for monitoring of the adductor pollicis, the great toe offers a better alternative. Stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve along the medial malleolus produces flexion of the great toe and has a time course that is comparable to the adductor pollicis. Importantly, if facial nerve stimulation is used during surgery because it is the only available site, it is prudent to switch from facial to ulnar nerve stimulation before pharmacological reversal at the end of the surgical procedure. An appropriate choice of reversal drug and dose requires a valid assessment of the level of neuromuscular blockade obtained at the gold standard site which is the ulnar nerve and adductor pollicis.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The twitch response of the great toe with stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve is preferred over evaluation of eye muscles with stimulation of the facial nerve when monitoring at the adductor pollicis is not available.</p>

<a id="page231"></a>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen167">E. Clinical Applications</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Neuromuscular monitoring should routinely commence immediately after induction of anesthesia, before NMBA administration. This has important advantages; it allows for confirmation that the monitor works, and it gives the clinician a good indication of the baseline response to stimulation. Restoration of normal neuromuscular function before extubation should yield the same response as at baseline. Moreover, modern monitors can automatically determine the appropriate supramaximal current and perform better when they are calibrated prior to NMBA administration. Knowledge of the time course for onset, duration, and recovery of neuromuscular block of NMBAs allows optimal care (<strong><a href="#ff11-13">Figure 11.13</a></strong>). Satisfactory intubating conditions are usually present before complete depression of the adductor pollicis twitch response.</p>
<p class="indent">Most surgical procedures can be performed under moderate block (TOFC 1-3). Deep block is defined as a level with TOFC&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;0 and PTC of at least 1. The role for deep block remains controversial; however, it is rarely required for lower abdominal surgery. If a level of block that prevents diaphragmatic movement is required, a PTC of 1 or 2 is usually sufficient.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff11-13"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff11-13.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="caption"><span class="fignum">Figure&#160;11.13</span> The plot shows train-of-four (TOF) ratios for 402 patients on arrival to the postanesthesia care unit. Each patient received only one dose of rocuronium 0.6&#x00A0;mg/kg and did not receive pharmacological reversal. There is substantial interpatient variation in duration of rocuronium, and the duration cannot be predicted in an individual patient. The dotted lines correspond to TOF ratio 0.4 and 0.9, respectively. With use of a peripheral nerve stimulator and subjective assessment, the majority of patients with TOF ratio &#x003E;0.4 would be expected to have a TOF count of 4 without appreciable fade. Quantitative monitoring is necessary to be able to determine the TOF ratio for these patients. Quantitative monitoring would also identify the 55% of patients who have spontaneously recovered to TOF ratio &#x2265;0.9 and therefore should not be exposed to pharmacological reversal drugs and their associated costs and potential side effects.
