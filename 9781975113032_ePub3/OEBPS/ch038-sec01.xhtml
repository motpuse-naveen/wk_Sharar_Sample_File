<h5 class="h5" id="sen678">A. Pain Processing</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The physiology of pain processing functionally comprises four steps: transduction, transmission, modulation, and perception. These processes are clinically <a id="page798"></a>relevant as each provides targets for pain treatment and prevention (<strong><a href="#ff38-1">Figure 38.1</a></strong>). <strong><em>Transduction</em></strong> is the generation of an action potential from a noxious chemical, mechanical, or thermal stimulus. <strong><em>Transmission</em></strong> is the propagation of the signal through the afferent pathway from the nociceptor to the sensory cortex. <strong><em>Modulation</em></strong> is the positive or negative adjustments in the pain signal along the afferent pathway, while <strong><em>perception</em></strong> is the integration of the pain signal into consciousness.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen679">B. Transduction</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nociceptors are located in the skin, mucosa, muscle, fascia, joint capsules, dura, viscera, and adventitia of blood vessels. Most A<em>&#x03B4;</em> and C nociceptors are polymodal (ie, their terminals express transducer channels that are sensitive to multiple stimuli). When they are activated by pressure, chemical, or thermal stimuli, the channels activate voltage-sensitive sodium and calcium channels, starting an action potential. Nociceptors can be activated by bradykinin, serotonin, and protons and sensitized by prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and cytokines. Glutamate, substance P, and nerve growth factor can also promote transduction of a pain signal (<strong><a href="#tt38-1">Table 38.1</a></strong>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen680">C. Transmission</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pain transmission occurs via a three-neuron afferent pathway, beginning in the periphery (<strong><a href="#ff38-2">Figure 38.2</a></strong>). First-order neuronal cell bodies are located in the dorsal root ganglia with fibers projecting to peripheral tissue where the receptors are located. Fibers enter the spinal cord and travel up or down through the posterolateral tract before entering the dorsal horn to synapse on second-order neurons. Second-order neuron cell bodies are located in the dorsal horn and are either nociceptive specific or wide dynamic range. Axons transmitting somatic nociception decussate and ascend via the contralateral spinothalamic tract, while axons transmitting visceral nociception ascend via the ipsilateral dorsal column medial lemniscus. Both synapse on the third-order neurons in the thalamus, the axons of which terminate in the sensory cortex. In the face, the primary afferent neuron has its cell body in the trigeminal ganglion and synapses on the second-order neuron in the medulla in the spinal trigeminal nucleus. From here, the signal is transmitted to the thalamus, as are pain signals from the rest of the body.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen681"><a id="page800"></a>D. Modulation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Modulation of the pain response occurs at many levels and can be positive or negative (<strong><a href="#ff38-3">Figure 38.3</a></strong>). Activity between first- and second-order neurons is decreased by feedback from interneurons and descending inhibition from <a id="page801"></a>the periaqueductal gray matter, rostral ventromedial medulla, and the dorsolateral pontine tegmentum. Augmentation of pain may occur as part of the transition from acute to chronic pain. Repetitive activation of wide dynamic range neurons by C fibers causes windup. Axonal sprouting causes crosstalk between different fibers, causing nonnoxious stimuli to become painful. In addition, neuromas and axonal sprouting may be associated with upregulation of sodium and downregulation of potassium channels, which cause destabilized cell membranes to become more prone to forming an action potential. Normally A<em>&#x03B2;</em> fibers do not produce substance P, but in the presence of tumor necrosis factor-<em>&#x03B1;</em> from injury, A<em>&#x03B2;</em> fibers can secrete it. This transition is termed <strong><em>phenotypic switch.</em></strong></p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen682">E. Perception</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Perception of pain is mediated by multiple structures. The primary and secondary somatosensory cortices are involved with sensory discrimination of pain. The frontal cortex and insula may facilitate learning and memory of pain. The anterior cingulate gyrus is related to emotional significance of pain, while the lentiform nucleus and cerebellum are involved in self-protective reflexes related to pain.</p>
