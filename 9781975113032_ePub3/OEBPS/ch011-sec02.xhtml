<p class="nonindent">Potency of a drug is determined by the dose required to produce a certain effect and is typically expressed in a dose versus response curve. Commonly, drug potency is expressed as the effective dose for a percentage of patients. As such, ED<sub>95</sub> represents the effective dose for 95% of patients. The expression of NMBA potency does not follow this convention. Most NMBA potencies are described as the dose required in half the population for 95% depression of maximal muscle contraction after nerve stimulation. This is more accurately captured by the notation ED<sub>50</sub>95% (in 50% of patients there is a 95% twitch reduction). ED<sub>95</sub> will be used in this chapter to indicate ED<sub>50</sub>95%. Onset of action (onset time) for all NMBAs is defined as the time from its administration (usually intravenous) until maximal neuromuscular block (disappearance<a id="page214"></a> of the single twitch, ST). Conventionally, two or three times the ED<sub>95</sub> is used for initiating paralysis. Onset time is inversely related to dose and can be affected by rate of delivery to the action site (blood flow, speed of injection, use of saline flush etc.), receptor affinity, mechanism of action (depolarizing vs competitive nondepolarizing), and plasma clearance (metabolism, redistribution). Duration of action until recovery to 25% (DUR 25%) is defined as the time from drug administration until recovery of ST to 25% of baseline (normal) strength. Significant paralysis persists at DUR 25% and it does not reflect return of adequate strength for extubation. A clinically more meaningful metric is the total duration of action defined as the time from drug administration until recovery of train-of-four ratio (TOFR) to 0.90 (DUR 0.90). Duration of action is directly related to the dose of NMBA administered.</p>

<p class="indent">NMBAs can be classified based on their mode of action: depolarizing NMBAs (eg, SCh) produce muscle relaxation by directly depolarizing the nAChRs (<strong><a href="#ff11-2">Figure 11.2</a></strong>). This occurs because SCh (made up of two ACh molecules joined end to end) acts as a &#x201C;false transmitter,&#x201D; mimicking ACh (<strong><a href="ch011-sec03.xhtml#ff11-3">Figure 11.3</a></strong>). Nondepolarizing NMBAs compete with ACh for the two &#x03B1; subunit recognition sites, preventing normal nAChR function. Nondepolarizing agents can be classified according to their chemical structure (benzylisoquinolinium or aminosteroid) or to their duration of action (short, intermediate, or long duration).</p>
