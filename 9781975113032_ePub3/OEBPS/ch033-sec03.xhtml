<p class="nonindent">The three factors that affect design and choice of <strong><em>pediatric breathing circuits</em></strong> are excessive resistance to flow, excessive dead space, and decreased heat and humidification. It is for these reasons that a variety of valveless breathing systems have been devised (<strong><a href="#ff33-3">Figure 33.3</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup></p>

<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ayre T-piece</em></strong> has no unidirectional gas flow valve and is effective for the spontaneously breathing patient. It is compact, can provide supplemental oxygen, and is not associated with rebreathing of carbon dioxide. Once neuromuscular relaxants were introduced into anesthesia practice, however, Ayre T-piece became ineffective, as it was difficult to provide the required positive pressure breathing with this device. The Jackson Rees modification of the Ayre T-piece solved this problem while maintaining the valveless system by adding a reservoir <a id="page708"></a>bag with a variable occlusion pop-off (a variably occluded pigtail on the bag). Although the Jackson Rees modification of the Ayre T-piece solved the need to be able to provide positive pressure breathing, it became apparent that another technical issue had to be solved&#x2014;the potential for rebreathing carbon dioxide.</p>

<p class="indent">Mapleson introduced variations on the Jackson Rees system to address the potential for rebreathing. Mapleson recognized that while rebreathing could occur because this system did not contain unidirectional gas flow valves, the sequential placement of the fresh gas inlet, the pop-off, the reservoir bag, and the connection to the patient can be varied. Depending on whether the patient was breathing spontaneously or was controlled with positive pressure, if the fresh gas flow was sufficient, carbon dioxide rebreathing could be minimized. There are six variations of the Mapleson system, the Mapleson D being commonly used in pediatric patient care. <strong><em>The Mapleson D system</em></strong> places the fresh gas inlet close to the connection to the patient&#x2019;s airway. The pop-off is farther away from the patient and fresh gas inflow, and the bag is distal to the pop-off. The popularity of the Mapleson D system results from its ability to minimize carbon dioxide rebreathing when controlled ventilation is the ventilatory mode. Rebreathing is also eliminated during spontaneous ventilation when the fresh gas flow is two to three times the patient&#x2019;s minute ventilation.</p>
<p class="indent">Modern-day pediatric anesthesia patient care effectively employs the <strong><em>circle breathing system</em></strong>, without undue resistance to the patient when opening the valves. It has the added benefit of conservation of the patient&#x2019;s heat and airway humidity. If concern exists that airway heat and humidity will be lost during ventilation with the anesthesia machine, a heater and humidifier can be incorporated into the circle system.</p>
<p class="indent">Recent reports demonstrate that by using the proper-sized <strong><em>cuffed endotracheal tube</em></strong>, the ability to provide positive pressure ventilation was enhanced. There was also less operating room anesthetic gas contamination, better isolation of the airway from gastric contents, and less need for additional laryngoscopies in attempts to select the proper size tube.</p>
