<h5 class="h5" id="sen168">A. Residual Neuromuscular Blockade</h5>
<p class="nonindent">For decades, investigators have shown that regardless of the NMBA used, over 40% of patients managed intraoperatively by clinical criteria or subjective evaluation had residual paralysis (TOFR &#x003C; 0.90) when tested objectively in the postanesthesia care unit.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib10">10</a>,<a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib11">11</a></sup> Residual paralysis is associated with adverse clinical consequences, especially pertaining to the respiratory system. These include impaired pharyngeal function with increased risk of aspiration, airway obstruction, hypoxemia, respiratory failure, reintubation, and postoperative atelectasis and pneumonia. Residual paralysis is an iatrogenic complication; it can and should be prevented. First, when paralysis is no longer required, a valid prereversal assessment should be obtained from the adductor pollicis muscle. Second, unless the block has recovered spontaneously to at least TOFR&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;0.9, an effective pharmacological reversal should be administered. Third, adequacy of neuromuscular function should be confirmed by quantitative monitoring before the final stage of emergence from anesthesia and tracheal extubation.</p>
<p class="indent">Clinical testing has been advocated for decades; tests such as grip strength, vital capacity, tidal volume, or leg lift are notoriously poor at detecting residual fade. In fact, none of these tests has a positive predictive value for detection of weakness when the TOFR exceeds 0.5. The best clinical test, the ability to resist removal of a tongue blade from clenched teeth, cannot be used in intubated patients. The only available approach to reliably confirm adequate recovery from NMBAs is quantitative monitoring.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen169">B. Anticholinesterase Agents</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Blocking the breakdown of ACh by AChAse results in an increase in the available pool of ACh at the synaptic cleft and better chances of competing with the nondepolarizing NMBA. The available AChAse inhibitors (anticholinesterase agents) are neostigmine, edrophonium, and pyridostigmine. Cholinesterase inhibitors are quaternary compounds and do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Their duration of action at equivalent doses, is similar (60-120 minutes), but onset of action is fastest for edrophonium, intermediate with neostigmine, and longest for pyridostigmine. Neostigmine is the most frequently used anticholinesterase agent today.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Neostigmine is most effective for reversal of minimal block (TOFR between 0.4 and 0.9). Its use is acceptable for shallow block (TOFR &#x003C; 0.4) only if quantitative monitoring is used.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen170">C. Factors Affecting Neostigmine Reversal</h5>
<p class="nonindent">It is important to consider that once neostigmine has been administered, there are two parallel processes that contribute to recovery. One is the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase which leads to an increased concentration of Ach; the other is the continued metabolism and elimination of NMBA. A major determinant of the effectiveness of neostigmine is the level of neuromuscular block. Traditionally, neostigmine reversal has been attempted for moderate block (TOFC 1-3). This is no longer recommended as its effectiveness is unreliable.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib12">12</a></sup> Even when the block is shallow, that is TOFC of 4 with subjective fade, there is no dose of neostigmine that can guarantee complete reversal to TOFR 0.9 within 10 minutes in 95% of patients.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib13">13</a>,<a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib14">14</a></sup> Only when the block is minimal (TOFC of 4 without fade or TOFR&#x00A0;&#x2265;&#x00A0;0.4) is neostigmine highly effective. Administration of neostigmine earlier than 10 to 15 minutes before anticipated extubation is not optimal because neostigmine has peak effect at approximately 10 minutes.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib15">15</a>,<a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib16">16</a></sup> Therefore, if full recovery to TOFR &#x2265;0.9 is not accomplished by 10 minutes after neostigmine administration, the most<a id="page233"></a> likely explanation is that the block was too deep for reversal with neostigmine. In this case, spontaneous recovery will continue (while neostigmine&#x2019;s effect somewhat diminishes after its peak), and the patient will eventually reach full recovery. When monitoring is performed by PNS and subjective evaluation, early administration of neostigmine for a block deeper than minimal has a significant disadvantage, namely that a longer and unpredictable period of time will be spent in the TOFR range 0.4 to 0.9.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib17">17</a></sup> This range has been referred to as the zone of blind paralysis and it is not possible to subjectively determine when the patient is fully recovered.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib18">18</a></sup> Neostigmine is relatively inexpensive and if quantitative monitoring is used, it is acceptable to attempt neostigmine reversal for a block with TOFC of 4 with fade, because a minority of patients will be successfully reversed. This approach is more likely to be successful in the context of total intravenous anesthesia and less likely to succeed with volatile anesthetics. For reversal of a block with TOFC of 4 with fade (and quantitative monitoring), an appropriate dose of neostigmine is 50 &#x00B5;g/kg. Higher doses than 50 &#x00B5;g/kg have not been shown to increase effectiveness. For neostigmine reversal of minimal block (TOFC 4 without fade or TOFR &#x2265; 0.4), a dose of 20 to 30 &#x00B5;g is recommended. There is no significant difference in the speed of recovery induced by neostigmine among the intermediate-acting nondepolarizing NMBAs. Age affects neostigmine-induced speed of reversal, being faster in children than in adults and slower in the elderly. Finally, drugs and conditions that potentiate the effect of nondepolarizing NMBAs will also prolong neostigmine-induced recovery time: volatile anesthetics, magnesium, and hypothermia.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen171">D. Neostigmine: Other Effects</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Neostigmine and edrophonium inhibit acetylcholinesterase at all cholinergic sites, including muscarinic receptors and therefore induce vagal stimulation. Therefore, anticholinergic agents such as atropine or glycopyrrolate are coadministered with anticholinesterase agents. Atropine is faster in onset than glycopyrrolate, produces more tachycardia, and crosses the blood-brain barrier. For these reasons, glycopyrrolate is preferred. Other side effects of neostigmine include increased salivation and bowel motility. Although anticholinergic agents are effective in preventing salivation, their effects on bowel motility are limited. A meta-analysis of the effects of neostigmine on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) have not supported a connection and the current guideline for management of PONV advises only against high dose neostigmine.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib19">19</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen172">E. Selective Relaxant Binding Agents: Sugammadex</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Sugammadex is a &#x03B3;-cyclodextrin with a central cavity that encapsulates the steroid nucleus of rocuronium and vecuronium. It has no affinity for any of the other depolarizing or nondepolarizing NMBAs. Binding to rocuronium is extremely tight, with no clinically relevant dissociation. Binding to vecuronium is one-third as tight, and the dose requirement for reversal of vecuronium is higher. Binding occurs in plasma and creates a rapid decrease in the plasma concentrations of NMBA. Free NMBA molecules at the neuromuscular junction move with the concentration gradient to the plasma compartment. As long as a sufficient dose of sugammadex is administered, the result is a highly effective reversal within a few minutes. The recommended dose is 2&#x00A0;mg/kg when the level of block has recovered to TOFC of 2, and 4&#x00A0;mg/kg for deeper blocks as long as the PTC is at least 1 (<strong><a href="#tt11-3">Table 11.3</a></strong>). These dose recommendations are adequate for reversal of both vecuronium- and rocuronium-induced<a id="page234"></a> neuromuscular block; however, reversal of rocuronium will be more rapid. Underdosing of sugammadex can lead to an incomplete reversal or to an initial reversal with reparalysis 15 to 30 minutes later. Therefore, it is critical that a valid prereversal assessment of neuromuscular blockade from the adductor pollicis is obtained and that dose recommendations are followed. Importantly, if no neuromuscular monitor is used, there is a risk of significant residual weakness, even with administration of sugammadex 2 to 4&#x00A0;mg/kg.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib20">20</a></sup> The dose recommendations above are not applicable if reversal is guided by assessment of the corrugator supercilii muscle.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib21">21</a></sup> As mentioned above, 16&#x00A0;mg/kg can effectively reverse rocuronium 1.2&#x00A0;mg/kg in an emergency situation, however, a number of other factors influence whether spontaneous ventilation will be restored. Unlike with anticholinesterase reversal, the type of anesthesia (intravenous or volatile) does not influence the ability of sugammadex to reverse rocuronium. The sugammadex-rocuronium complexes are excreted via the kidneys, with an elimination half-life of 100 minutes. It is not FDA-approved for use in patients with renal failure (CrCl &#x003C; 30&#x00A0;mL/min), although reports of successful use have been published.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib22">22</a></sup></p>

<h6 class="h6">1. Clinical Use, Side Effects, and Safety</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Sugammadex is an important addition to the anesthesiologist&#x2019;s armamentarium. The leading safety concern is the potential for hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic shock. The perioperative prevalence of anaphylactic reactions is estimated to be between 1:3500 and 1:20,000 cases, with an associated mortality of up to 9%.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib23">23</a></sup> The risk of hypersensitivity reactions is significantly greater with sugammadex than with neostigmine, and the risk has been reported to increase when higher doses are administered.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib24">24</a></sup> There has been concern that the risk of hypersensitivity reactions will increase with more widespread use.</p>
<p class="indent">Sugammadex has been associated with cardiac arrhythmias, including marked bradycardia and asystole. ECG monitoring should be routine when sugammadex is administered.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib25">25</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Sugammadex can bind also hormonal contraceptives and therefore inhibit their effectiveness. Women of childbearing age should be advised to use alternative nonhormonal means of birth control for 1&#x00A0;week after exposure.</p>
