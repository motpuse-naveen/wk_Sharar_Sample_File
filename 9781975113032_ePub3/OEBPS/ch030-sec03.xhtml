<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Intracranial hypertension</em></strong> is any condition in which ICP is raised above 15&#x00A0;mm Hg. The cranium is a closed vault, composed of brain tissue, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). When one of these components enlarges to occupy more space (eg, brain tumor, bleeding), compensation occurs, usually by vasoconstriction and CSF drainage out of the cranium and into the spinal column. <strong><em>Intracranial elastance</em></strong>, however, becomes very limited as ICP reaches a critical point, where sudden, even very small increases in volume can lead to dramatic increases in pressure within the cranium (<strong><a href="#ff30-6">Figure 30.6</a></strong>). The results can be neurologically devastating, with herniation of the brainstem into the foramen magnum and subsequent irreversible damage or even death. Hence, meticulous care in those patients in whom elevated ICP is suspected (eg, avoiding hypoventilation, emergent surgical decompression, or CSF diversion) is critical.</p>

<p class="indent">As for the spinal cord, damage can be acute (leading to weakness, loss of sensation, or paralysis) or chronic (causing pain and deformity). <strong><em>Acute spinal cord compression</em></strong>, due to trauma or tumor, is usually a surgical emergency, as time to decompression is correlated with functional outcome. Patients may be flaccid initially and severely hypotensive, due to a relative sympathectomy. Resuscitation and hemodynamic support are mainstays of treatment at this time. The role of steroids in preventing secondary injury is more controversial. Cervical injuries necessitate extremely careful management of the airway. These injuries are associated with more physiologic perturbations than lower injuries, including diaphragmatic paralysis, cardiac disturbances, and death.</p>

(<strong>1</strong>) Intracranial pressure remains low and relatively constant at low volumes until the &#x201C;elbow&#x201D; of the curve is reached. (<strong>2</strong>) At this point, small changes in volume lead to moderate changes in pressure. (<strong>3</strong>) When a critical intracranial volume is reached, the pressure increases precipitously.</figcaption></figure></div>
