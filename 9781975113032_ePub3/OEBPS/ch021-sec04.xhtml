<p class="nonindent">Blockade of the lumbar and sacral plexuses can be used for surgical anesthesia or analgesia of the lower extremities. When compared with neuraxial anesthesia, lower extremity peripheral nerve blocks provide prolonged analgesia without side effects such as hypotension, urinary retention, and contralateral muscle weakness. Due to the anatomic separation between the lumbar and sacral plexuses, a single injection cannot provide complete anesthesia of the entire lower extremity.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen333">A. Lumbar Plexus</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The lumbar plexus is formed from the ventral rami of nerve roots of T12 and L1-L4 bilaterally and gives rise to six major nerves: the femoral, obturator, lateral cutaneous, ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genitofemoral nerves (<strong><a href="#ff21-14">Figure 21.14</a></strong>).</p>

<p class="indent">The femoral nerve (L2-L4) is the largest nerve of the lumbar plexus. It provides the primary innervation to the knee and can be used for postoperative analgesia for total knee arthroplasty, anterior cruciate ligament repair, as well as surgery involving the patellar tendon. The femoral nerve sends motor branches to the quadriceps muscles and provides the cutaneous innervation for the anterior thigh and knee. The femoral nerve is located approximately 1 to 2&#x00A0;cm lateral to the femoral artery at the level of the inguinal crease. The terminal branch of the femoral nerve is the saphenous nerve, which innervates the skin of the medial knee, calf, and ankle, and can be blocked in the adductor canal with minimal motor weakness.</p>
<p class="indent">The obturator nerve (L2-L4) supplies the cutaneous innervation to the medial thigh and knee. The motor innervation of adductors of the leg (adductor longus, gracilis, adductor brevis, and pectineus) is to a variable extent supplied by the obturator nerve. The medial knee can be supplied by articular branches of the obturator nerve. The obturator nerve courses from the medial border of the psoas major muscle and then courses along the lateral wall of the pelvic cavity toward the obturator canal.</p>
<p class="indent">The genitofemoral nerve (L1-L2) supplies the cremaster muscle and skin over the scrotum in men and the anterior part of the labium majorus and mons pubis in women. The lateral cutaneous nerve (L2-L3) supplies the cutaneous innervation to the lateral thigh.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen334">B. Sacral Plexus</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The anterior rami of S1-S4 join the lumbosacral trunk after exiting the sacral foramina toward the sacral plexus. Various nerves are derived from the sacral plexus including the pudendal nerve, gluteal nerves, and pelvic splanchnic nerves, yet the nerves most relevant to lower extremity surgery are the sciatic nerve and the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh (<strong><a href="#ff21-14">Figure 21.14</a></strong>).</p>
<a id="page456"></a>
<p class="indent">The sciatic nerve (L4-S3) passes through the sciatic notch, anterior to the piriformis muscle, and then travels lateral and deep to the biceps femoris tendon at the gluteal crease. At this level, the nerve is located between the ischial tuberosity and the greater trochanter of the femur. As the nerve approaches the popliteal fossa, the two components&#x2014;tibial (medial) and peroneal (lateral)&#x2014;separate at a variable distance from the knee. The common peroneal nerve terminates as the superficial peroneal, deep peroneal, and lateral sural nerves in the foot and primarily innervates the dorsal surface of the foot as well as the dorsiflexors of the foot. The tibial nerve terminates as the posterior tibial nerve and the medial sural nerve. The tibial nerve innervates the plantar flexors of the foot, including the gastrocnemius, soleus, popliteus, and plantaris muscles.</p>
<p class="indent">The nerves at the ankle derived from the sciatic nerve include the posterior tibial, superficial peroneal, deep peroneal, and sural. The saphenous nerve is the only nerve at the ankle that is a branch of the femoral nerve. The posterior tibial nerve branches into the calcaneal, medial plantar, and lateral plantar nerves. The posterior tibial nerve provides motor innervation (plantar flexors), cutaneous innervation (plantar surface of the foot), and bony innervation to the foot. The deep peroneal nerve provides cutaneous innervation to the web space between the first and second toe and terminates as the second, third, and fourth dorsal interosseous nerves. The superficial peroneal nerve provides the cutaneous innervation to the dorsum of the foot except for the lateral aspect of the dorsum, which is supplied by the sural nerve. The saphenous nerve supplies the cutaneous innervation to the medial ankle and foot.</p>
