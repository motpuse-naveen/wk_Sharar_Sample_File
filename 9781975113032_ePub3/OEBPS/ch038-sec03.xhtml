<h4 class="h4" id="sec243">III. Pharmacologic Management of Pain</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen683">A. Opioids</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Opioids are useful for acute pain and cancer-related pain and can be a component of a chronic pain regimen. In acute pain, short-acting agents are typically used alone. In chronic pain, 80% of the daily dose is given in a basal long-acting medication with the remainder given as a short acting opioid as needed for breakthrough. When assessing patients for opioid management, it is important to inquire about the level of analgesia provided, whether the patient&#x2019;s functional status is improved, the side effects of therapy, and whether the patient displays aberrant behaviors (ie, early refills, lost pills, unscheduled appearance in the clinic).</p>
<p class="indent">Opioids bind to the <em>&#x03BC;, &#x03BA;,</em> and <em>&#x03B4;</em> receptors to cause analgesia and side effects, such as pruritus, nausea, constipation, and respiratory depression. Various opioids have different potencies, bioavailabilities, and dosages (<strong><a href="#tt38-2">Table 38.2</a></strong>). For ease of comparison and conversion from one medication to another, they are all compared to the prototypical opioid, morphine. When converting from one opioid to another, it is important to reduce the expected dosage by 25% to 50% to account for incomplete cross-tolerance to the new agent. When treating patients with opioids, precision of terminology is important. <strong><em>Tolerance</em></strong> is the phenomenon of decreased effect of a given amount of medication. It usually occurs after prolonged administration of the drug. <strong><em>Dependence</em></strong> is the physiologic condition of withdrawal symptoms when an opioid is discontinued. <strong><em>Addiction</em></strong> is a disease marked by altered behavior to seek the desired substance despite negative consequences. <strong><em>Pseudoaddiction</em></strong> is aberrant drug-seeking behavior due to undertreatment of pain.</p>

<p class="indent">Morphine is metabolized by the liver to morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) and morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), which are renally excreted. M6G is analgesic due to <em>&#x03BC;</em>-binding activity and is responsible for respiratory depression, sedation, and nausea. M3G has no <em>&#x03BC;</em> effect and is associated with hyperalgesia, seizures, and tolerance. Morphine&#x2019;s half-life is 2 hours, but its duration of action is 4 to 5 hours due to its slow elimination from the brain compartment.</p>
<p class="indent">Hydromorphone is five times more potent than morphine and is associated with fewer side effects. It is metabolized in the liver to dihydromorphine and dihydroisomorphine, which are active, and hydromorphone-3-glucuronide, which does not cause analgesia but is similar in side effects to M3G. Its onset is 15 minutes when administered intravenously and its duration of action is similar to that of morphine.</p>

<p class="TABLEpNUM" id="tt38-2"><strong><span class="tab">Table&#160;38.2</span> Opioid Pharmacokinetics and Equianalgesic Dosing</strong></p>
<p class="center"><img src="images/tt38-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Fentanyl is 80 times more potent than morphine and is associated with less histamine release and pruritus. It is more lipophilic than morphine. It is metabolized by the liver and is appropriate for patients with renal failure. It is available as a transdermal patch. Due to gradual absorption of the drug, the patch requires 6 to 8 hours to reach maximum plasma concentrations. The patch provides steady-state analgesia without periods of side effects related to high serum concentrations and periods of pain due to low serum concentrations. After removal of the patch, significant serum levels remain; hence, intramuscular opioid should not be given immediately.</p>
<p class="indent">Sufentanil is 1000 times as potent as morphine and is typically used in intraoperative infusions or neuraxially. It has a slightly shorter elimination half-life than fentanyl. Alfentanil is 10 times the potency of morphine and has its peak effect within 2 minutes. It has a very short duration of action, &#x003C;10 minutes, and is ideal for brief periods of intraoperative stimulation. Remifentanil is approximately 100 times the potency of morphine. Like alfentanil, it is also rapid acting. It is eliminated by plasma cholinesterases, so its terminal half-life is 10 to 20 minutes. Its termination of analgesia is so rapid that it may result in rebound hyperalgesia.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page804"></a>Methadone is a unique opioid because it enhances analgesia by antagonizing the <em>N</em>-methyl-<span class="usmall">D</span>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and inhibiting serotonin reuptake in addition to its <em>&#x03BC;</em> effect. It is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 and has many drug interactions. It has a variably long elimination half-life, between 8 and 80 hours, requiring slow titration to avoid accidental overdose. After a single dose, it provides analgesia for 3 to 6 hours, but with prolonged around-the-clock dosing, the duration of analgesia can be 8 to 12 hours. Methadone can cause prolonged QT and torsades de pointes, requiring periodic electrocardiograms.</p>
<p class="indent">Meperidine is a short-acting opioid that is metabolized in the liver to normeperidine, which can be neurotoxic and result in seizures, especially in the setting of renal failure or prolonged dosing. It is indicated for short-term use only. Its most common usage is in low doses to treat postoperative rigors.</p>
<p class="indent">Oxycodone is activated by conversion to oxymorphone; it is approximately twice as potent as morphine. Both drugs are associated with less pruritus than morphine. Tramadol, hydrocodone, and codeine are considered weak opioids. Tramadol is a <em>&#x03BC;</em> agonist with monoaminergic properties. It carries low rates of constipation, respiratory failure, and abuse. Codeine is a prodrug that is metabolized to morphine by cytochrome P450 2D6. Reductions in enzymatic activity, as seen in children and certain ethnic groups (whites and Asians), cause decreased analgesia and increased respiratory depression.</p>

<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Acetaminophen is a centrally acting COX inhibitor with minimal peripheral action that causes analgesia and antipyrexia but has no anti-inflammatory effect.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen684">B. Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) work by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, exerting anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. COX-1 is present in healthy tissue and serves gastroprotective and hemostatic functions. COX-2 is induced in injury and produces prostaglandins that sensitize peripheral nociceptors to pain and promote hyperalgesia. NSAIDs are effective at reducing postoperative pain and opioid consumption and are commonly used in both acute and chronic pain. Side effects include platelet dysfunction, nephrotoxicity, and gastric ulcers. Acetaminophen is a centrally acting COX inhibitor with minimal peripheral action. It causes analgesia and antipyrexia but has no anti-inflammatory effect.</p>

<p class="dify">Chronic nerve damage is associated with spontaneous ectopic firing of neurons and anticonvulsants reduce ectopic signals by blocking sodium or calcium channels. Thus, anticonvulsants may be useful in treating neuropathic pain.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen685">C. Anticonvulsants</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Chronic nerve damage is associated with spontaneous ectopic firing of neurons and changes in sodium and calcium channel expression. Anticonvulsants reduce ectopic signals by blocking sodium or calcium channels. Gabapentin and pregabalin both block <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub>-<em>&#x03B4;</em> subunit of calcium channels. Both have been shown to be helpful in multiple neuropathic pain syndromes, including postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), diabetic painful neuropathy (DPN), trigeminal neuralgia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) neuropathy, spinal cord injury pain, phantom limb pain, and poststroke pain. In acute pain, preoperative gabapentin has been shown to decrease narcotic requirements, improve pain control, and reduce opioid-related side effects. Neither gabapentin nor pregabalin have significant drug-drug interactions. Side effects of both drugs include dizziness, fatigue, peripheral edema, cognitive slowing, and reduced renal function.</p>

</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen686">D. Antidepressants</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) exert an independent analgesic effect distinct from their mood stabilizing properties. TCAs affect many pathways, including inhibition of <a id="page805"></a>the reuptake of serotonin and adenosine, interaction with <em>&#x03B1;</em> receptors, opioid receptor binding, and blockade of sodium channels, calcium channels, and NMDA receptors. They are effective at treating neuropathic pain, especially PHN and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), but frequent side effects limit their use. These include sedation, xerostomia, urinary retention, and blurred vision and tend to be more pronounced in the elderly. Nortriptyline and desipramine are better tolerated than amitriptyline.</p>
<p class="indent">SNRIs cause pain relief by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine more than serotonin. SNRIs (duloxetine and milnacipran) are effective in DPN and fibromyalgia and are commonly prescribed in other neuropathic pain syndromes because of their minimal side-effect profile compared with TCAs. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have not been proven to have analgesic properties outside of their beneficial effect on depressive symptoms.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen687">E. <strong><em>N</em></strong>-methyl-<span class="small">D</span>-aspartate Antagonists</h5>
<p class="nonindent">NMDA receptors provide a nonopioid strategy for pain management and can be helpful in the opioid-dependent patient. NMDA stimulation is thought to play a role in development of chronic pain, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and windup. Ketamine is the prototypical NMDA antagonist. It has poor oral bioavailability, so it is used in intravenous infusions to reduce opioid requirements. Dosage is limited by side effects, including tachycardia, salivation, and dysphoria.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen688">F. Alpha Adrenergics</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Clonidine and dexmedetomidine are both central <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub> agonists. Binding causes reduced norepinephrine output, which causes sedation and analgesia in addition to reduced heart rate and blood pressure without affecting respiratory drive. The half-life of clonidine is 9 to 10 hours. It can be given orally, intravenously, or intrathecally. When given as a transdermal patch, it can be helpful to mitigate adrenergic symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The half-life of dexmedetomidine is 2 hours. Because it is much more selective for <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub> than <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>, as compared with clonidine, intravenous infusion is used for profound sedation with analgesia, with a lower incidence of bradycardia and hypotension.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen689">G. Glucocorticoids</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Glucocorticoids, including dexamethasone, inhibit phospholipase A2 to block the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes and have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. They are useful perioperatively to reduce pain and nausea but may be associated with poor wound healing. Bursts of steroids (eg, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone) can be useful in the management of chronic pain, such as radiculitis, but side effects such as gastric ulcers, osteoporosis, water retention, hypertension, and hyperglycemia limit long-term use.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen690">H. Local Anesthetics</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Lidocaine can be delivered in patch form directly to an area of neuropathic pain. The medication is slowly absorbed and blocks sodium channel locally, rather than a systemic effect. It can be helpful in PHN, peripheral neuropathy, osteoarthritis, myofascial pain, and low-back pain. It may require as long as 2&#x00A0;weeks of daily patch use to obtain relief. Intravenous lidocaine infusion can be given for neuropathic pain resistant to other treatments. Dosing is typically 5&#x00A0;mg/kg over 30 minutes. Mexiletine is an orally available local anesthetic with a similar effect to intravenous lidocaine.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen691">I. Topical Agents</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Capsaicin&#x2019;s mechanism <a id="page806"></a>of action is to stimulate TRPV1 receptors, which then causes reduced nerve fiber density. Substance P may also be depleted. It is available in a low concentration cream, which must be applied three to four times daily for weeks to experience relief. A patch form (8%) is effective in PHN, DPN, and HIV neuropathy when applied. Local anesthetic ointment must be applied for an hour before the patch to mitigate the burning sensation of the patch; relief from one application can last 12&#x00A0;weeks.</p>
