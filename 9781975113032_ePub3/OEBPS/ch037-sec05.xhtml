<h5 class="h5" id="sen666">A. Management of Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Screening asymptomatic patients for carotid stenosis is not recommended because CEA is beneficial for only a very select group of asymptomatic patient and only if the expected risk of CVA is less with CEA than without it.<sup><a href="ch037-sec07.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen667">B. Management of Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms of carotid artery stenosis include sudden unilateral vision loss (amaurosis fugax) and unilateral changes in motor function, dysarthria, and aphasia. These symptoms require <strong><em>urgent evaluation</em></strong> and treatment to minimize the risk of permanent neurologic damage. If performed expertly, CEA is effective in reducing this risk in symptomatic patients with moderate and high-grade carotid stenosis.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen668">C. Preoperative Evaluation and Preparation for Carotid Endarterectomy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The preoperative evaluation of vascular surgical patient includes the essential elements required for all surgical patients (<a href="ch016.xhtml">Chapter 16</a>). CEA is defined by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) as an intermediate-risk procedure, with the possibility of cardiac death or nonfatal MI being &#x003C;5%.<sup><a href="ch037-sec07.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> The ACC/AHA algorithm defines an evidence-based approach to the preoperative evaluation (<strong><a href="ch037-sec02.xhtml#ff37-2">Figure 37.2</a></strong>). If preoperative medical management with <strong><em>anticoagulants</em></strong> or <strong><em>antiplatelet drugs</em></strong> does not control symptoms of carotid stenosis, CEA is urgent. Preoperative reduction of hypertension is controversial especially if the carotid stenosis is severe or bilateral. Sudden reduction in blood pressure should be avoided.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen669">D. Monitoring and Preserving Neurologic Integrity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Monitoring for cerebral ischemia during CEA is controversial. Some centers advocate providing regional anesthesia and argue that the awake patient can report neurologic changes most reliably. Others advocate general anesthesia to ensure a motionless surgical field, and they rely on continuous electroencephalogram, somatosensory-evoked potentials, transcranial Doppler, or cerebral oximetry. Each method has its limitations and challenges, and neither regional nor general anesthesia has provided better <strong><em>neurologic outcomes</em></strong>. With either technique, if there are signs of cerebral ischemia, blood pressure should be optimized (usually to the patient&#x2019;s normal awake level) or a shunt placed, if not already in use.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen670">E. Anesthetic Management for Elective Surgery</h5>
<p class="nonindent">No one anesthetic approach has been proven best for patients undergoing CEA. Both regional and general anesthesia are employed safely.<sup><a href="ch037-sec07.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> With either approach, the patient must be awake and cooperative at the end of the procedure for ongoing <strong><em>neurologic assessment</em></strong>. Given the very high incidence of CAD and hypertensive heart disease in this patient population, etomidate and esmolol are often used in combination for induction of general anesthesia and abatement of the stimulation of endotracheal intubation. For patients at low <a id="page791"></a>risk from the hypotensive effects of propofol, it may be used instead of etomidate to reduce the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting. General anesthesia can be maintained by intravenous or inhaled anesthetics with the caveat that <strong><em>blood pressure</em></strong> must be maintained at or near the patient&#x2019;s normal resting level. Isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane reduce cerebral oxygen consumption and provide ischemic preconditioning for the heart and other organs. Despite these potential advantages, they have not been proven to improve outcome, perhaps because the majority of CVAs are caused by <strong><em>emboli</em></strong> from the surgical site. Regional anesthesia techniques include deep and superficial cervical plexus blocks, as well as cervical epidural anesthesia and local infiltration. In addition to standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitors, continuous direct arterial blood pressure monitoring is highly recommended because blood pressure control is vital during CEA.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen671">F. Carotid Angioplasty With Stenting</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Since its clinical introduction over three&#x00A0;decades ago, carotid angioplasty with stenting has since emerged as an alternative treatment to CEA. Compared with CEA, carotid stenting is associated with a higher risk of periprocedural stroke and death, especially in older patients. However, long-term data now show that carotid stenting and CEA have similar overall outcomes when comparing risk of stroke, MI, death, and functional status, after 10&#x00A0;years of follow-up.<sup><a href="ch037-sec07.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen672">G. Postoperative Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The most urgent and potentially devastating complication of CEA is clot formation at the surgical site and the associated <strong><em>thromboembolism</em></strong> to the cerebral circulation. A new onset neurologic change after surgery requires immediate ultrasound examination of the operative site and reoperation if indicated. Other complications presenting in the early postoperative period include stroke from emboli or hypoperfusion during surgery, severe hyper- and hypotension, myocardial ischemia, cranial and recurrent nerve injuries, and wound hematoma. Control of severe hypertension is vital because if uncontrolled, it is associated with increased mortality and increased cardiac and neurologic complications. Additionally, persistent severe postoperative hypertension increases the risk of cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome, characterized by headaches, seizures, and focal neurologic signs. An <strong><em>expanding wound hematoma</em></strong> can obstruct the airway, necessitating emergent evacuation of the hematoma before an adequate airway can be reestablished.</p>
