<h5 class="h5" id="sen618">A. Monitoring</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Standard anesthetic monitoring is used in all thoracic surgery cases. An invasive <strong><em>arterial line</em></strong> is placed for the majority of surgeries. It is useful to measure baseline preoperative ABGs for intraoperative comparison during <strong><em>one-lung ventilation (OLV)</em></strong>, detection of sudden blood pressure changes, and postoperative weaning of mechanical ventilation. A central venous line may be required in some cases for vascular access or for infusion of vasoactive medications. The central venous pressure (CVP) can be a useful intraoperative and postoperative monitor, particularly for cases where fluid management is critical, such as pneumonectomies and esophagectomies. Fluid management for all thoracic procedures should follow either a restricted or a goal-directed protocol. However, recently, concerns about <strong><em>acute kidney injury</em></strong> have called into question the strategy of fluid restriction in thoracic surgery.<sup><a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup> No fluids are given for theoretical &#x201C;third-space&#x201D; losses. Colloids have not been proven to improve outcome and add considerable expense. Spirometry is particularly useful to monitor breath-by-breath inspired and expired tidal volumes during OLV and may alert the clinician to possible loss of lung isolation, air leaks, and the development of hyperinflation.<sup><a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen619">B. Physiology of OLV</h5>
<p class="nonindent">In the majority of thoracic surgery cases, patients transition from being upright, awake, and spontaneously breathing to supine, asleep, and paralyzed. They are then moved from the supine position to the lateral position. Finally, <a id="page752"></a>OLV is initiated, and their chest is opened. Changes in ventilation and perfusion accompany each of these circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">First, functional residual capacity (FRC) is the main factor determining oxygen reserve in patients when they become apneic. Patients will experience a decrease in FRC when in the supine position compared with the upright position. This change will be magnified by the induction of anesthesia and administration of muscle relaxants. When upright, the majority of ventilation and perfusion reach the gravity-dependent portions of the lungs (ie, the bases). With the induction of anesthesia, most of the ventilation now enters the nondependent portions of the lung, increasing ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, in the lateral position, the dependent lung receives more perfusion compared with the nondependent lung. However, the dependent hemidiaphragm is pushed into the thoracic cavity by the abdominal contents, further decreasing FRC and worsening/mismatch.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, when the chest is opened, the compliance of the nondependent lung improves relative to the dependent lung, and it is preferentially ventilated, further increasing the/mismatch. However, when OLV is initiated in the dependent lung, it receives the majority of both perfusion and ventilation. There will still be some cardiac output shunted through the collapsed, nondependent lung, but/matching may be improved by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) in the nonventilated, nondependent lung (<strong><a href="#ff35-1">Figure 35.1</a></strong>). HPV can be inhibited by many factors, such as extremes of pulmonary artery pressures, hypocapnia, vasodilators, and inhalational agents.<sup><a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup></p>

The Qs/Qt during two-lung ventilation is assumed to be distributed equally between the two lungs (5% to each lung). The essential difference between two-lung ventilation and OLV is that, during OLV, the nonventilated lung has some blood flow and therefore an obligatory shunt, which is not present during two-lung ventilation. The 35% of total flow perfusing the nondependent lung, which was not shunt flow, was assumed to be able to reduce its blood flow by 50% by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. The increase in Qs/Qt from two-lung to OLV is assumed to be due solely to the increase in blood flow through the nonventilated, nondependent lung during OLV.

<h5 class="h5" id="sen620">C. Indications for OLV</h5>
<p class="nonindent">High and intermediate priorities for OLV are listed in <strong><a href="#tt35-3">Table 35.3</a></strong>. The highest priorities include prevention of <strong><em>contamination</em></strong> of the healthy lung by infection or hemorrhage; control of distribution of ventilation in bronchopleural fistula, unilateral bullae, or airway disruption; unilateral lung lavage; and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Intermediate priorities for OLV include surgical exposure in thoracic aortic aneurysm repair, pneumonectomy, lung volume reduction, minimally invasive cardiac surgery, and upper lobectomy. Lower indications for OLV include surgical exposure in esophageal surgery, middle and lower lobectomy, mediastinal mass resection, and bilateral sympathectomies.<sup><a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen621">D. Methods of Lung Isolation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Lung isolation can be achieved with the use of a <strong><em>double-lumen tube (DLT)</em></strong>, bronchial blocker, or endobronchial intubation with a regular single-lumen tube (SLT) or specialized endobronchial tube. An SLT is rarely used in an endobronchial fashion in adults except in emergent scenarios, as bronchoscopy, suction, or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) cannot be applied to the collapsed lung.</p>

<p class="video1" id="vid35-1"><strong>VIDEO 35.1</strong></p>
<p class="video2"><strong>Double-Lumen Tube Description</strong></p>
<p class="indent">DLTs are the most commonly used method to achieve lung isolation and OLV (<strong><a href="#ff35-2">Figure 35.2</a></strong>). They are available in both left- and right-sided conformations, with the left-sided DLT being the most widely used. Advantages of the DLT include the ability to isolate either lung; apply suction, CPAP, or oxygen insufflation down either lumen; and perform bronchoscopy down either lumen. The DLT is less likely to dislodge than other methods of lung separation, which makes it the <strong><em>preferred method</em></strong> of isolation in cases of infection or hemorrhage. Disadvantages of the DLT include the fact that it is more challenging to place in a difficult airway, and it will usually need to be exchanged for an SLT if a patient is to remain intubated postoperatively.</p>
<p class="indent">A <strong><em>bronchial blocker</em></strong> placed through an SLT can also be used to achieve lung isolation (<strong><a href="#ff35-3">Figure 35.3</a></strong>). A bronchoscope is used to direct the blocker to the lung or lung segment that is to be collapsed. Several advantages of the blocker include the flexibility for use in an oral or nasotracheal fashion and for selective lobar blockade. It is particularly useful in scenarios such as a <strong><em>difficult airway</em></strong> or the need for postoperative ventilation. The main disadvantage of a bronchial blocker is that it can be displaced from changes in patient position or surgical manipulation. This is especially detrimental in a situation where loss of lung separation can lead to contamination from blood or pus.<sup><a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup></p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen622">E. Management of OLV</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Fraction of Inspired Oxygen</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">When initiating OLV, a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) of 1.0 is generally used to prevent hypoxemia. An ABG test may be taken to determine arterial partial pressure of O<sub>2</sub>. If this is adequate, the FiO<sub>2</sub> may be titrated down.<sup><a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup></p>
<h6 class="h6">Tidal Volume and Respiratory Rate</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The current trend in OLV is to use <strong><em>lung-protective strategies</em></strong>. Whether using volume-controlled or pressure-controlled ventilation, tidal volume should be approximately 5&#x00A0;mL/kg. The respiratory rate is then titrated to maintain an acceptable range of end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) or arterial partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (35-40&#x00A0;mm Hg). Peak airway pressures should be maintained at &#x003C;35&#x00A0;cm&#x00A0;H<sub>2</sub>O, and preferably &#x003C;25&#x00A0;cm&#x00A0;H<sub>2</sub>O.<sup><a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup> In the presence of bullous disease, even lower airway pressures must be considered.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen623">F. Management of Hypoxemia on OLV</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction</em></strong> can take hours to reach full effect. If hypoxemia develops during OLV, the FiO<sub>2</sub> should be increased to 1.0. Bronchoscopy should be performed to confirm tube position. The most effective treatment of hypoxemia is to apply 5 to 10&#x00A0;cm&#x00A0;H<sub>2</sub>O of <strong><em>CPAP</em></strong> to the nondependent lung. However, as this is the operative lung, CPAP can interfere with the surgical exposure. Thus, the application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to the dependent lung may then be useful to increase FRC and / matching. This should be limited to approximately 10&#x00A0;cm&#x00A0;H<sub>2</sub>O in order to prevent overdistension of the alveoli, which can elevate pulmonary vascular resistance and increase shunting. <strong><em>Recruitment maneuvers</em></strong> and intermittent ventilation of the operative lung may be performed if hypoxemia persists. Additionally, as inhalational anesthetics are known to inhibit HPV, total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) may be considered. If a pneumonectomy is being performed, clamping of the pulmonary artery will eliminate the shunt and improve oxygenation<sup><a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch035-sec04.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup> (<strong><a href="#tt35-4">Table 35.4</a></strong>).</p>
