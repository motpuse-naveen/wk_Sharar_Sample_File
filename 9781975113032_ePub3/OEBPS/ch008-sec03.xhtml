<h4 class="h4" id="sec49">III. Neuropharmacology of Inhaled Anesthetics</h4>
<p class="nonindent">As with other drugs, the clinical effects of inhaled anesthetics are dependent on the administered dose. However, because the concentration of gas in the blood is difficult to measure, the depth of inhaled anesthesia is generally expressed in terms of the more readily measured end-exhalation, or alveolar, concentration. Thus, a 1% alveolar concentration of sevoflurane is equivalent at 1&#x00A0;atmosphere (760&#x00A0;mm Hg) to a partial pressure of 7.6&#x00A0;mm Hg in the blood (and brain).</p>

<p class="dify">MAC values are more useful to compare potency of different inhaled anesthetic agents. Administering at least 0.7 MAC end-tidal concentration of inhaled anesthetics is needed for prevention of recall and intraoperative awareness.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The concept of <strong><em>minimum alveolar concentration (MAC)</em></strong> is commonly used to compare the pharmacologic effects of one inhaled anesthetic to another. One MAC is the concentration of an inhaled anesthetic at which 50% of patients do not move in response to a standard surgical stimulation (such as a skin incision). Consequently, if only an inhaled anesthetic is used for a surgical procedure, then more than 1 MAC must be administered to ensure all patients are unresponsive. MAC values are additive. For example, 0.5 MAC of sevoflurane and 0.5 MAC of nitrous oxide is equivalent to 1 MAC. Similarly, concomitant administration of opioids and sedatives reduces MAC. Some of the many factors that may increase or decrease MAC are listed in <strong><a href="#tt8-3">Table 8.3</a></strong>.</p>

<p class="indent">All the newer inhaled anesthetics depress cerebral metabolic rate in a similar fashion, resulting in an isoelectric electroencephalogram. They usually produce a loss of consciousness and amnesia at relatively lower inspired concentrations (25%-35% of MAC), although there is considerable variation in sensitivity among individuals. There is controversy whether sevoflurane has any proconvulsant effects, and its use in patients with epilepsy is questioned. All the potent agents cause a dose-dependent increase in cerebral blood flow (<strong><a href="#ff8-3">Figure 8.3</a></strong>). Changes in intracranial pressure parallel the increase in cerebral blood flow at<a id="page157"></a> a dose of 1 MAC or above. Inhalation anesthetics offer some degree of cerebral protection from ischemic or hypoxic insults. However, conclusive evidence in humans for sevoflurane and desflurane is lacking. The effects of nitrous oxide on cerebral physiology are not very clear as its effects vary among different species. Nitrous oxide may even have antineuroprotective properties. All the inhaled anesthetics can produce a dose-dependent depression of sensory and motor-evoked potentials. Visual-evoked potentials are the most sensitive to the effects of volatile agents. There is increasing evidence that the inhalation anesthetics may be one of the main contributing factors for the development of short-term cognitive impairment following surgery, particularly in elderly adults.</p>
