<h4 class="h4" id="sec170">II. Hepatic Disease</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with hepatic disease present for hepatic and nonhepatic surgery and are at increased risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen433">A. Assessment of Hepatic Function</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hepatic functions include bile production, protein synthesis, regulation of glucose metabolism, lipid and protein metabolism, hematopoiesis, and drug and metabolite clearance. Clinical evidence of liver disease can be subtle. Risk factors (alcoholism, illicit drug use, sexual promiscuity, blood transfusions) provide clues to possible hepatic disease. Signs and symptoms often include loss of appetite, malaise, pruritus, abdominal pain, indigestion, jaundice, and changes in urine or stool color. Patients with advanced disease may have ascites, palmer erythema, gynecomastia, spider angiomas, or encephalopathy.</p>
<p class="indent">Standard liver function tests provide information about hepatocyte integrity, cholestasis, and hepatic synthetic function, while other tests evaluate the extent and nature of hepatic injury. <strong><a href="#tt28-2">Table 28.2</a></strong> lists the various tests commonly used to evaluate the liver.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen434">B. Hepatic and Hepatobiliary Diseases</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Drug toxicity and infection are the most common causes of acute liver disease, which may progress to acute liver failure, resolve spontaneously, or develop into chronic liver failure. Other causes include alcoholic hepatitis, nonacetaminophen drug toxicity, and pregnancy-related hepatic disease. Chronic liver disease is usually a consequence of viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Chronic liver disease can lead to portal hypertension, cirrhosis, and malignancy.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen435">C. Cirrhosis and Portal Hypertension</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Cirrhosis describes the pathological transformation of liver tissue into nodules surrounded by fibrous bands. Recurrent episodes of inflammation cause hepatic parenchymal necrosis and fibrosis. These changes also cause an increase in resistance to blood flow through the hepatic capillary bed, causing portal hypertension. The most common cause of cirrhosis in the United States is alcohol. Other causes include viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, chronic right heart failure, autoimmune disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Systemic manifestations of cirrhosis and portal hypertension are listed in <strong><a href="#tt28-3">Table 28.3</a></strong>.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Hemostasis</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Laboratory tests in cirrhotic patients often show alterations in the procoagulant system. However, the anticoagulant system is also altered. Hence, tests of coagulation should be interpreted carefully. Hepatic disease can lead to anemia of chronic disease due to red blood cell destruction and bone marrow suppression. Patients may also have dysfibrinogenemia. Thrombocytopenia develops as a result of decreased production and increased splenic sequestration. Fibrinolysis may occur in cirrhotic patients because of decreased clearance of tissue plasminogen activator.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Cardiac</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cirrhosis and portal hypertension cause an increase in the production of vasodilators, which results in a so-called hyperdynamic circulation with high cardiac output and low systemic vascular resistance. Systolic blood pressure is often &#x003C;100&#x00A0;mm Hg. A large amount of blood is sequestered in the splanchnic bed, causing a decreased effective circulating volume. Arteriovenous shunts develop, both in systemic and pulmonary circulation, leading to increased cardiac output.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><a id="page594"></a>Renal</h6>
<p class="nonindent">As cirrhosis progresses, there is an increase in cardiac output and decrease in systemic vascular resistance. There is also activation of the sympathetic, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, and vasopressin systems. This leads to ascites, peripheral edema, and electrolyte disturbances, including dilutional hyponatremia and hypokalemia (from secondary hypoaldosteronism). Patients are at risk of renal hypoperfusion due to decreased effective circulating volume, systemic hypotension, diuresis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and diarrhea as well as other renal insults, including drug-related nephrotoxicity, sepsis, and immune complex&#x2013;related nephropathies. Hepatorenal syndrome is an extreme manifestation of the systemic circulatory derangement in cirrhosis and refers to the symptom complex characterized with azotemia, ascites, and oliguria. There is also intense constriction of the renal afferent arteriole, which causes a decrease in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Pulmonary</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Ascites and pleural effusion can cause ventilation-perfusion mismatch in cirrhotic patients due to restriction of lung expansion, creation of intrapulmonary arteriovenous channels, and atelectasis. Portal hypertension also causes hepatopulmonary syndrome (liver dysfunction, unexplained hypoxemia, and intrapulmonary vascular dilatation causing right-to-left shunting) and portopulmonary hypertension (pulmonary hypertension with no other known cause in patients with portal hypertension).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Encephalopathy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hepatic encephalopathy is related to the amount of hepatic parenchymal damage and shunting of portal venous blood into the systemic circulation. Gastrointestinal bleeding, increased oral protein intake, dehydration, infections, and worsening liver function can precipitate this condition. Hyperammonemia caused by cirrhosis can lead to increased intracranial pressure. Neurologic signs include altered mental status with fluctuating asterixis and hyperreflexia, along with characteristic high-voltage, slow-wave activity on electroencephalography. Treatment includes supportive care, amelioration of the precipitating cause, and oral lactulose or neomycin to decrease intestinal ammonia absorption.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Ascites</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Portal hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, lymphatic fluid seepage from the diseased liver, and renal fluid retention are all implicated in the development of cirrhotic ascites. Treatment includes salt restriction, diuretics, paracentesis, and, occasionally, a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) procedure. It is recommended that large-volume (&#x003E;5&#x00A0;L) ascitic fluid drainage be accompanied with albumin replacement (6-8&#x00A0;g/L). Rapid drainage of a large volume of ascites causes paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (PICD) in up to 80% of patients, when no fluid replacement is used. The incidence is reduced to 15% to 30% when volume expanders are used. Patients with ascites are at increased risk for the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis due to bacterial translocation from the bowel flora. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain strict aseptic technique during any procedural interventions.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><a id="page595"></a>Varices</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Esophageal varices develop as portosystemic shunts because of portal hypertension. They can cause massive bleeding, leading to hypovolemia from blood loss. Treatment includes supportive care, endoscopic sclerotherapy, electrocoagulation or banding, medical therapy (vasopressin, somatostatin, or propranolol), and balloon tamponade (with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube). Anesthetic challenges include the full stomach, fragile physiology, acute hypovolemia, and encephalopathy. Bleeding from varices into the gastrointestinal track can serve as a nitrogen load and worsen the encephalopathy.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen436">D. Preoperative Evaluation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Preoperatively, the severity of liver disease and the risk of surgery can be estimated using the modified Child-Turcotte Pugh score (commonly known as the Child-Pugh Score) and MELD (model for end-stage liver disease) scoring systems. The Child-Pugh score is described in <strong><a href="#tt28-4">Table 28.4</a></strong>. The MELD score ranks patients according to their risk of death from liver disease, based on a logarithmic calculation of creatinine, bilirubin, and the international normalized ratio of the prothrombin time. The MELD score is typically used to prioritize patients on the liver transplant list. In 2016, serum sodium was also added to the MELD score calculation in recognition of hyponatremia as an additional risk factor. Adding age and ASA classification to MELD score also increases its predictive value for estimating survival after nontransplant surgery in cirrhotic patients.</p>
<p class="indent">On preoperative evaluation, minor elevations of liver function tests in asymptomatic patients are most likely irrelevant.<sup><a href="ch028-sec03.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup> More significant elevations and the presence of risk factors or evidence of liver disease should prompt further investigation. Contraindications to elective surgery include fulminant hepatic failure, acute hepatitis, Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis, heart failure, acute kidney injury, and severe coagulopathy (platelet count &#x003C;50,000/&#x00B5;L).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen437">E. Intraoperative Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hemodynamic monitoring for patients with end-stage liver disease should include an arterial catheter and other invasive monitoring, depending on the extent of the surgery and the patient&#x2019;s comorbidities. Neuromuscular blockade monitoring is also recommended since the metabolism and duration of action of many neuromuscular blocking agents is altered by liver failure and associated renal insufficiency. Transesophageal echocardiography should be performed with caution because of the risk of bleeding from esophageal varices, although the data from published case series suggest the risk is low.</p>
<p class="indent">Ascites and variceal bleeding can increase the risk of aspiration during anesthetic induction. Induction doses of intravenous induction agents are short acting despite liver disease, because the action is terminated by redistribution. However, with repeat doses or infusions, a prolonged duration of action can be expected. For procedures requiring sedation, propofol is preferable to benzodiazepines, since it has a quicker onset and rapid redistribution. Inhaled anesthetic agents may cause a significant reduction in hepatic blood flow; however, isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane are all considered safe for use. The action of opioid agents is often prolonged due to a higher free fraction in the blood because of reduced circulating albumin levels. In addition, patients with liver disease often have an exaggerated response to sedatives. Cisatracurium is the neuromuscular blocker of choice, owing to its organ-independent metabolism.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Although many drugs are metabolized in the liver, the duration of action following a single dose may be shorter than expected. This is because cardiac output is high in advanced liver disease and drug action is terminated primarily by redistribution.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Maintenance of circulating volume as well as hepatic and renal perfusion is important. However, in patients undergoing abdominal surgery, a restrictive fluid strategy helps decrease bleeding by minimizing portal venous pressure. Cirrhotic patients often exhibit a diminished response to endogenous and exogenous vasoconstrictors, necessitating higher doses. Hypotension, high mean airway pressures during mechanical ventilation, and sympathetic stimulation should be avoided.</p>
<p class="indent">During major surgery, the utility of standard testing of the coagulation system (eg, prothrombin time, platelet count) is limited. Viscoelastic tests like thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) are preferred for the management of bleeding in high-risk patients.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen438">F. Specific Procedures</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt Procedure</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is indicated for decompression of portal hypertension in the setting of esophageal varices or intractable ascites. A shunt is placed transvenously, connecting the portal circulation to a hepatic vein (<strong><a href="#ff28-4">Figure 28.4</a></strong>). Monitored anesthesia care or general anesthesia may be used. Acute volume overload due to influx of portal blood into the systemic circulation is a frequent complication, and this may unmask previously undiagnosed heart failure or pulmonary hypertension. Since the shunted blood bypasses the liver, new or worsening hepatic encephalopathy is seen in up to 30% to 35% patients after the procedure, occurring soon after TIPS insertion.</p>
<p class="indent">Since TIPS is usually performed for end-stage liver disease, these patients usually have massive ascites and atelectasis, both of which make lying flat difficult. If a general anesthetic is planned, rapid sequence intubation is recommended. In addition to encephalopathy, postprocedural complications include bleeding, pneumothorax, vascular injury, and dysrhythmia.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Hepatic Resection</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hepatic resections are most commonly performed for malignancy (primary hepatobiliary or metastatic) and carry a high perioperative mortality risk. Adequate vascular access and cross-matched blood should be available to combat massive hemorrhage. Prevention of hypothermia is essential to allow normal hemostasis. Blood loss also depends on site of surgery; the right lobe of the liver represents about two-thirds of its total mass and hence is associated with a higher bleeding risk. In the initial stages of the surgery, drainage of ascites can lead to significant fluid shifts, and placement of retractors for exposure can cause respiratory and hemodynamic compromise. Compression of the inferior vena cava (IVC) during exposure and control of vascular supply leads to diminished preload. Liver blood flow can be manipulated with vascular clamping below and above the liver, but this can also cause significant hemodynamic fluctuations. Maintaining a low central venous pressure (CVP) (&#x003C;5&#x00A0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O) with a fluid restrictive strategy and with vasodilators like nitroglycerin helps decrease blood loss and transfusion requirements. The head-up position should not be used to decrease CVP, since it can increase the risk of venous air embolism. An abrupt drop in end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>, with rising pulmonary artery pressures, should raise suspicion of a significant air embolism. Laboratory testing&#x2013;guided administration of procoagulants is necessary to improve clotting without unwanted thrombotic complications.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen439">G. Hepatic Transplantation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Alcohol- or hepatitis-induced chronic, severe hepatocellular disease is the most common indication for liver transplantation. The MELD scoring system allows for prioritization of organ allocation, with score adjustments for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatopulmonary syndrome. Fulminant hepatic failure puts patients on the top of the waiting list.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients presenting for liver transplantation usually have had an extensive diagnostic workup. Immediate preoperative assessment should include <a id="page598"></a>evaluation for a change in functional status since the last assessment, recent oral intake, options for vascular access, and neurologic and renal function.</p>
<p class="indent">Large-bore venous access is necessary for rapid volume administration, often through a rapid infusion device. Arterial and central venous catheterization is necessary. Transesophageal echocardiography can help with the management of hemodynamic instabilities due to hypovolemia, IVC manipulation, right ventricular failure, pulmonary embolus, or dynamic left ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction. Electroencephalogram can be used to monitor the depth of anesthesia, allowing for titration of anesthetic agents.</p>
<p class="indent">A preinduction arterial catheter is recommended, followed by preoxygenation and rapid-sequence induction. Intravenous fluids should be warmed, and forced-air warming devices should be used. Immunosuppressive drugs, their doses, and timing should be discussed with the surgical team prior to surgery. Cross-matched blood products should be available in the operating room.</p>
<p class="indent">The intraoperative course is divided into the preanhepatic, anhepatic, and the neohepatic or reperfusion phase. The <strong><em>preanhepatic</em></strong> phase has similar anesthetic implications as encountered during hepatic resection. Preoperative coagulopathy is managed by administering blood products. Venovenous bypass may be necessary if IVC clamping is performed. The <strong><em>anhepatic</em></strong> phase begins with clamping of the vascular supply to the liver, usually starting with the hepatic artery. After a period of relative stability, graft reperfusion starts with flushing of the preservative fluid by perfusion through the portal vein to the hepatic vein and the surgical field. Maintenance of euvolemia is important during this phase of controlled bleeding. With reanastomosis of the hepatic vein, acidemia and embolism can cause pulmonary hypertension with severe cardiopulmonary instability. Vasopressors, inotropes, and pulmonary vasodilators are often necessary to support blood pressure. The anesthesiologist also needs to monitor the serum electrolyte, glucose, and acid-base status. Patients are at particular risk of hypocalcemia, due to high volume infusion of citrated blood products, and hyperkalemia, because of underlying renal function, potassium-sparing diuretic use, blood transfusion, splanchnic ischemia, and acidosis.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>

<p class="indent">Early in the <strong><em>neohepatic</em></strong> phase, patients develop a hypocoagulable, fibrinolytic state. Maintenance of hemostasis is accomplished with guidance from conventional coagulation tests as well as viscoelastic tests (TEG and ROTEM). Postoperatively, patients can develop fluid overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and intra-abdominal hypertension related to massive transfusion. Anastomotic leaks or stenosis or thrombosis of a vascular anastomosis may require urgent surgical reexploration.</p>
