<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications</em></strong> target various points within the hemostatic pathways. Antiplatelet medications prevent platelet activation and aggregation, while anticoagulant medications inhibit coagulation factor activation at various points within secondary hemostasis. <strong><a href="#tt24-4">Table 24.4</a></strong> outlines the specific targets inhibited by each drug along with some details about monitoring their effect and drugs that can be used in the event of bleeding emergencies.</p>

<p class="indent">Antiplatelet therapy is the mainstay of treatment for cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease. Aspirin is an irreversible inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase, thereby preventing the synthesis of thromboxane, a major stimulant for platelet activation. The second most used class of antiplatelet medications includes clopidogrel and ticlopidine, P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonists, which result <a id="page519"></a>in a decreased expression of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors on the surface of activated platelets, thereby inhibiting platelet adhesion and aggregation. Finally, the direct glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists&#x2014;abciximab and eptifibatide&#x2014;prevent platelet aggregation by inhibiting the crosslink of fibrinogen. These agents are only available for intravenous administration and are primarily used in treatment of acute coronary syndrome.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfractionated heparin is one of the oldest and most used medications for anticoagulation, especially for emergency treatment of pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, vascular thrombosis, or cardiopulmonary bypass. It acts by improving the affinity of antithrombin for thrombin, thereby inhibiting the final step of secondary hemostasis. The therapeutic effects of heparin primarily inhibit the intrinsic and common coagulation pathway and can be monitored with the activated partial thromboplastin time or the activated clotting time. However, it is a large molecule with significant risks of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a disorder characterized by microvascular thrombosis secondary to platelet-activating IgG antibodies to the heparin and platelet factor 4 complexes. Low-molecular-weight heparins such as enoxaparin, fondaparinox, and dalteparin inhibit the activation of factor X as a means of preventing thrombin formation and hemostasis. They are smaller molecules with longer half-lives making them less likely to cause HIT and suitable for intermittent therapeutic dosing that does not require an infusion. Enoxaparin should be used with caution in patients with renal dysfunction and creatinine clearance &#x003C;30&#x00A0;mL/min. Parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors such as argatroban and bivalirudin bind to free thrombin preventing ongoing hemostatic activity. They are primarily indicated for patients with HIT or those with a heparin allergy and can be monitored with activated clotting times.<sup><a href="#bib14">14</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Warfarin is a classic oral anticoagulant medication clinically used for treatment and prophylaxis in patients at high risk for stroke or venous thromboembolism such as those with a hypercoagulable disorder (ie, lupus anticoagulant, factor V Leiden, antithrombin deficiency) or a history of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, heart valve replacement, or atrial fibrillation. Mechanistically, it is a vitamin K antagonist that prevents the hepatic synthesis of vitamin K&#x2013;dependent coagulation factors, including factors II, VII, IX, and X. Incidentally, it also prevents the synthesis of protein C, a natural anticoagulant with a short half-life. Therefore, patients initiated on warfarin treatment will be hypercoagulable for the first 1 to 2&#x00A0;days until the available supply of factors is depleted. The effective concentration of warfarin is highly variable between patients and commonly affected by food and drug interactions. Regular monitoring is necessary and facilitated by the international normalized ratio (INR), a hemostatic assay designed to normalize the prothrombin time across different laboratories for patients with a combined deficiency of factors II, VII, IX, and X. For patients on warfarin therapy who experience a bleeding emergency, the warfarin should be reversed with vitamin K supplementation or 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs). Plasma is the second-line therapy indicated for urgent warfarin reversal only if PCCs are not available.<sup><a href="#bib14">14</a></sup> The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) include dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, and rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or apixaban, direct factor Xa antagonists. This class of anticoagulants is very popular for patients at risk of venous thromboembolism or stroke related to atrial fibrillation because of their rapid onset, simple dosing, and lack of need for regular laboratory monitoring secondary to a high degree of bioavailability and few significant drug or food interactions.<sup><a href="#bib15">15</a></sup></p>

</div>
<p class="indent">There is active research around specific antidotes for treatment of critical hemorrhage or bleeding emergencies in patients on DOACs. Dabigatran can be fully reversed with the administration of the monoclonal antibody, idarucizumab.<sup><a href="#bib16">16</a></sup> Furthermore, there is widely accepted evidence and FDA approval for the use of andexanet alfa, an inactive recombinant form of coagulation factor Xa, for the blockade of direct acting factor Xa inhibitors including rivaroxaban and apixaban.<sup><a href="#bib17">17</a></sup> Andexanet alfa has not been studied for edoxaban, although the mechanism of effect is directed at all factor Xa inhibitors. In the absence of andexanet alfa, current recommendations dictate the use of 4-factor PCCs for treatment of critical bleeding in patients on DOAC therapy.<sup><a href="#bib15">15</a></sup> In the stable patient scheduled for surgery, the most recent guidelines suggest waiting four to five half-lives of a DOAC prior to elective procedures, including neuraxial anesthesia, and longer for patients with renal insufficiency. <strong><a href="#tt24-5">Table 24.5</a></strong> outlines the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin versus the DOACs.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a>,<a href="#bib18">18</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Hemostatic medications serve an integral role in patient blood management and the control of hemorrhage by promoting the formation and stabilization of blood clots. There are several mechanistic targets for procoagulant agents from the initiation of primary hemostasis to the activation of clotting factors. However, it is imperative that these agents target only the site of vascular injury as systemic activation of hemostatic pathways can lead to catastrophic arterial and venous thromboembolism.</p>
<p class="indent">Desmopressin (1-deamino-8-<span class="usmall">D</span>-arginine vasopressin [DDAVP]) is a synthetic analogue of vasopressin with a wide range of hemostatic effects, some of which are still poorly understood. DDAVP is clinically indicated for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with platelet dysfunction, often related to uremia, hemophilia, and von Willebrand disease, as it facilitates the cleavage of factor VIII and vWF to increase the activity of both factors, thereby improving platelet function. Additionally, DDAVP provides a modest decrease in bleeding associated with major surgery such as spinal fusion, revision orthopedic procedures, and high-risk cardiac surgery, without a significant increased risk of thromboembolism. Other adverse effects of DDAVP<a id="page521"></a> include hyponatremia and resultant cerebral edema, but this is clinically rare in the adult population.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Antifibrinolytics prevent the dissolution of established blood clots, thereby improving vascular integrity at the site of injury and decreasing bleeding. There are two types of antifibrinolytics. Aprotinin is a serine protease inhibitor that directly inhibits plasmin. It is not available in the United States because a large randomized trial demonstrated an association between use of aprotinin and increased morbidity and mortality. However, it has been proven to be effective at decreasing blood loss and transfusion requirements for patients undergoing high-risk surgery and is currently approved for use in Canada and Europe.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The lysine analogue antifibrinolytics, including epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) and tranexamic acid (TXA), inhibit the cleavage of plasminogen to plasmin. They are less potent than aprotinin and in comparative trials less effective, but the incidence of thromboembolism and adverse effects from TXA and EACA are minimal, making them an attractive option for prophylaxis in patients at risk for major bleeding. Large clinical trials in trauma patients, as well as many studies in cardiac and orthopedic surgical patients, have documented the clinical efficacy of these medications especially when used prophylactically.<sup><a href="#bib3">3</a>,<a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Factor concentrates provide the substrates for the secondary hemostasis phase of the clotting cascade without the transfusion risks associated with plasma administration. Concentrates can be delivered individually when indicated, for example, factor VIII concentrates in classic hemophilia. Recombinant activated factor VII is currently approved for treatment of hemophilia in patients with inhibitors to factors VIII or IX.</p>
<p class="indent">PCCs have different compositions, but generally include varied amounts of three to four factor concentrates, including factors II, IX, X, and sometimes VII. For most of the PCCs, these factors are administered inactive and complexed with an anticoagulant such as antithrombin, protein C, or heparin, making the overall therapy less likely to cause unwanted thromboembolism. PCCs are currently indicated for treatment of hemophilia patients with inhibitors to specific factor concentrates. However, they are more frequently used as the first-line reversal agents for warfarin and the DOACs in cases of critical bleeding. It is important to recognize that these medications carry a risk of arterial and venous thromboembolism and should be redosed with extreme caution. They are contraindicated in patients with suspicion of having DIC, a systemic disorder of uncontrolled hemostasis with microvascular clotting, coagulation factor, and platelet consumption that may progress to multiorgan system failure and massive hemorrhage.</p>
