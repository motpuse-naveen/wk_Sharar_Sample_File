<p class="video2"><strong>Malignant Hyperthermia</strong></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen254">A. Malignant Hyperthermia</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Malignant hyperthermia (MH)</em></strong> is an autosomal dominant, hypermetabolic disorder triggered by halogenated volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine. The principal diagnostic features of MH are unexplained hypercapnia, tachycardia, muscle rigidity, acidosis, hyperthermia, and hyperkalemia. The disorder is variable in its presentation. A ryanodine receptor (RYR) gene mutation is the etiology in the majority of cases. Precipitation of MH in genetically susceptible patients occurs when the RYR, a type of calcium channel located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane, is activated during an exposure to a triggering agent, resulting in a tremendous release of intracellular calcium within skeletal muscle.</p>
<a id="page370"></a>
<p class="indent">Detection and treatment are critical for survival. If MH is suspected, triggering agents should be discontinued immediately. Dantrolene should be administered intravenously, with an initial dose of 2.5&#x00A0;mg/kg, with repeat dosing as needed. MH can be lethal if untreated. Rhabdomyolysis and hyperkalemia should be managed with volume resuscitation and diuresis. Cooling should be instituted immediately with monitoring for coagulopathy. Ventilatory support should be maintained until the patient is stabilized. Once stabilized, the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States hotline should be contacted. Recurrence of MH is possible, and patients should be monitored for up to 72 hours.</p>
<p class="indent">The in vitro contracture test is used to analyze the presence of muscle fiber contraction during halothane and caffeine exposure. It is the standard for diagnosis of MH susceptibility. Genetic testing may be pursued with appropriate counseling for patients about the implications of testing results. MH-susceptible patients planning to undergo surgery should have a thoroughly purged anesthesia machine available for use, whether or not the patient is to receive a general anesthetic. Triggering agents should be avoided. Total intravenous general anesthesia should be considered if regional anesthesia is not possible.<sup><a href="ch017-sec10.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen255">B. Porphyria</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Porphyrias</em></strong> are a group of enzyme deficiencies that result in heme and P450 cytochrome biosynthesis impairment and a concomitant accumulation of harmful metabolites. <strong><em>Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP)</em></strong> is among the most severe of the porphyrias. It is a deficiency in porphobilinogen deaminase that leads to nonspecific neuropsychiatric and abdominal complaints. Symptoms include severe abdominal pain, vomiting, seizures, tachycardia, and generalized weakness. Triggers include infection, fasting, ethanol, and medications, including barbiturates, etomidate, and phenytoin. Treatment of symptoms entails the discontinuation of triggers and infusion of hemin. Liver transplantation is reserved for AIP patients with severe, recurrent attacks (<strong><a href="#ff17-2">Figure 17.2</a></strong>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen256">C. Cholinesterase Disorders</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pseudocholinesterase (PChE) deficiency is an inherited or acquired disorder that results in an inability to efficiently metabolize specific ester substrates. <a id="page371"></a>Prolonged paralysis after an anesthetic procedure using succinylcholine usually reveals this deficiency. Delayed metabolism is also seen with use of mivacurium, cocaine, chloroprocaine, procaine, and tetracaine. Deficiency of this hepatic esterase can be due to PChE gene mutations or systemic disease, such as severe liver disease, renal failure, carcinomas, and severe malnutrition. PChE activity and dibucaine inhibition testing can be used to identify individuals at high risk for prolonged paralysis following succinylcholine administration.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen257">D. Glycogen Storage Diseases</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Glycogen storage diseases (GSDs)</em></strong> are a rare group of inherited disorders of glycogen production and metabolism that result in excess glycogen storage. Hypoglycemia, metabolic ketoacidosis, and infiltrative organ dysfunction are common among most types of GSD. There are numerous types of GSD, each with a unique set of characteristics based on factors such as enzyme mutation and clinical features (<strong><a href="#ff17-3">Figure 17.3</a></strong>, <strong><a href="ch017-sec08.xhtml#tt17-1">Table 17.1</a></strong>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen258">E. Osteogenesis Imperfecta</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)</em></strong> is an inherited connective tissue disorder that produces a defect in type I collagen synthesis, which is critical to bone and tissue strength. Pediatric bone fractures from minimal trauma, blue sclera, and a family history of OI are usually adequate for diagnosis. Cardiovascular manifestations of OI include arterial dissections and aortic and mitral valve regurgitation. Several types of OI exist, classified by type, inheritance pattern, and clinical features.</p>
