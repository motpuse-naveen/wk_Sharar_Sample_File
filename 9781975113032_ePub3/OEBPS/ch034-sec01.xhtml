<h4 class="h4" id="sec217">I. Physiology of Organ Aging</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Biological aging is accompanied by changes that lead to a progressive decline in physiological reserve. Despite the body&#x2019;s reparative mechanisms, oxidative stress and other processes result in accumulation of cellular damage and senescence. Systemic conditions that cause inflammation and exhaustion of stem cells in turn result in the development of comorbidities and chronic disease. Age-related reductions in strength and activity lead to loss of muscle mass and function, resulting in frailty and disability. Defining what constitutes &#x201C;normal aging&#x201D; is difficult. Longitudinal studies that follow a group of healthy subjects over a long period provide an opportunity to examine age-related changes. Below we will discuss some of the changes that occur in older adults and their respective influence on anesthesia care. The reader is reminded to keep two principles in mind. First, the effect of aging varies considerably from one individual to another. Second, disease processes interact with aging processes to further diminish functional organ reserve.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen591">A. Cardiovascular Aging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Virtually all components of the cardiovascular system are affected by aging.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup> The major changes include the following: (1) decreased response to &#x03B2;-receptor stimulation; (2) stiffening of the myocardium, arteries, and veins; (3) changes in the autonomic nervous system, specifically, increased sympathetic activity and decreased parasympathetic activity; (4) conduction system changes; and (5) defective ischemic preconditioning. Although mechanisms of aging contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, it is not clear that aging inevitably leads to functional impairment or disease. <strong><a href="#tt34-1">Table 34.1</a></strong> outlines some of the most common cardiac changes and comorbidities associated with aging.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page732"></a>Vascular aging as well as atherosclerosis reduces elasticity and lead to progressively less compliant arteries.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> Arterial stiffening creates a retrograde wave of pressure that returns to the heart during late ejection. The decrease in vascular elasticity increases left ventricular work and leads to cardiac muscle hypertrophy. As hypertrophy progresses, it impairs relaxation of the ventricle during diastole which impedes left ventricular filling. The ventricle becomes increasingly dependent on the atrial kick for adequate diastolic filling. This phenomenon, termed diastolic dysfunction, increases in severity with age. Furthermore, adequate ventricular filling becomes more important with age. This is because the contractile and chronotropic response to &#x03B2;-receptor stimulation decreases with age, and cardiac performance becomes increasingly dependent on an adequate end-diastolic volume via the length-tension (Frank-Starling) relationship. With increased left ventricular filling pressures comes elevated pulmonary and central venous pressures and the potential precipitation of congestive heart failure symptoms. Most cases of congestive heart failure in very old persons are due to diastolic dysfunction and occur in the absence of clinically significant systolic dysfunction.</p>
<p class="indent">Veins also stiffen with age. As veins are the major vascular volume reservoir, their reduced compliance impairs the ability to buffer against even modest changes in venous blood volume, as evidenced by the fact that elderly persons are more likely to exhibit postural hypotension compared to young adults.</p>
<p class="indent">Rhythm disturbances may develop with age. Fibrosis of the conduction system may lead to conduction blocks. Loss of sinoatrial node cells makes older patients more prone to sick sinus syndrome. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation increases exponentially with age, largely due to atrial enlargement.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen592">B. Pulmonary Aging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Total lung capacity (TLC) and functional residual capacity (FRC) remain relatively constant with age. However, expiratory reserve volume (ERV) decreases and residual volume (RV) increases. These changes are mainly due to loss of connective tissue and elasticity of the lung parenchyma. The lung volume at which the small airways (respiratory bronchioles) begin to close is termed the &#x201C;closing capacity.&#x201D; In older patients, closing capacity exceeds FRC, resulting in atelectasis at baseline for many elderly patients (<strong><a href="#ff34-2">Figure 34.2</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">With aging, the thorax becomes barrel shaped and the chest wall stiffens, which leads to flattening of the diaphragm. There is also age-related loss of muscle mass. With these two effects combined, it is easy to understand why the older patient is more prone to fatigue when challenged by an increase in minute ventilation, and thus more likely to experience respiratory failure. Aging also blunts the ventilatory responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia, especially at night.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib6">6</a></sup> Aging results in less effective coughing and impaired swallowing and may play a role in the development of postoperative pulmonary complications.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen593">C. Metabolic Changes, Liver, and Kidney Aging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Changes in body composition with age are primarily characterized by a gradual loss of skeletal muscle and an increase in body fat, even if body weight remains stable. Basal metabolic rate declines with age, but it is not clear if changes in body composition lead to a reduction in metabolic rate or if reduction in basal metabolic rate and fat oxidation lead to loss of muscle and accumulation of fat.</p>
<p class="indent">Aging is associated with decreased insulin secretion in response to a glucose load, along with increased insulin resistance, particularly in skeletal muscle. Thus, even healthy elderly patients may require perioperative insulin therapy more often than their younger counterparts. Despite this fact, one should be careful to avoid hypoglycemia when insulin therapy is administered. Insulin is degraded by the liver and kidneys, and in older adults, hypoglycemia is more common and leads to worse outcomes.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup></p>

<div class="figureu5" id="ff34-2"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff34-2.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="ucaption"><span class="u_fignum">Figure&#160;34.2</span> <strong>Changes in spirometry values with aging. There is virtually no change in total lung capacity. However, expiratory reserve volume decreases and residual volume increases. The sum of these&#x2014;functional residual capacity&#x2014;is largely unchanged. Note that closing capacity can exceed functional residual capacity leading to increased atelectasis.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Liver mass and its blood flow decreases with age. Consequently, a modest reduction in phase I drug metabolism and bile secretion is expected.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup> However, there is a significant reserve built into the liver, and unless liver function is simultaneously affected by another pathological process, one can generally expect only minor age-related dosing changes for most anesthetic drugs. However, changes in body composition may alter pharmacodynamics and result in markedly increased metabolic half-lives for many drugs, especially benzodiazepines and opioids.</p>
<p class="indent">Quite different are the kidneys where significant pharmacokinetic changes occur with age. After about the age of 40 years, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases by about 1&#x00A0;mL/min every year (<strong><a href="#ff34-3">Figure 34.3</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib9">9</a></sup> Common comorbidities of the elderly such as hypertension and diabetes can greatly accelerate this decrease in GFR. The dosing of many commonly used medications must account for renal impairment once GFR falls below 60&#x00A0;mL/min. Also, as GFR decreases, maintaining fluid and electrolyte hemostasis becomes increasingly difficult.</p>

<p class="dify">The metabolic half-life of diazepam in a 72-year-old is approximately 3&#x00A0;days.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen594">D. Central Nervous System Aging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">As we grow older, there is a loss of brain volume, especially in the frontal cortex. Age-related changes to cerebral vasculature and a higher prevalence of hypertension increase the risk for stroke and ischemia; white matter lesions are often observed on imaging studies. The major effect of brain aging on anesthetic management is an increased sensitivity to many anesthetic agents.</p>

<div class="figureu5" id="ff34-3"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff34-3.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="ucaption"><span class="u_fignum">Figure&#160;34.3</span> <strong>At around 40&#x00A0;years of age, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases at a rate of 1&#x00A0;mL/min per year. In addition to this steady decrease, other common comorbid conditions such as hypertension and diabetes can further decrease GFR.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Perhaps the best-known example is the approximately 6% decrease in minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) that occurs per decade after the age of 40 years (<strong><a href="#ff34-4">Figure 34.4</a></strong>). For example, the MAC of sevoflurane for an 80-year-old is 1.4%, whereas it is around 2.1% for a 20-year-old.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib10">10</a></sup> Age-adjusted MAC should be used for inhalational agents. The brain is also more sensitive to the effects of many intravenous anesthetic agents. The dose of intravenous anesthetics should be reduced and titrated slowly due to longer circulation times. It is much more challenging to manage and quantify the potential interaction <a id="page735"></a>of anesthesia and surgical stress on a brain with reduced reserve. Postoperative neurocognitive disorders (delirium and cognitive decline) are a major challenge for providers and source of fear and anxiety for patients and their families.</p>
