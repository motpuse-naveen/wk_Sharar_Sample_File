<h4 class="h4" id="sec41">IV. Hepatic Metabolic, Synthetic, and Excretory Functions</h4>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Bile</em></strong> formation is an essential, hepatic function enabling the elimination of lipids, cholesterol, and metabolic end products of hemoglobin metabolism and the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and lipids. Bile secretion by hepatocytes into the canaliculi encompasses the energy-dependent transport of bile acids and organic anions as well as glutathione, bilirubin glucuronide, thyroid and steroid hormones, and xenobiotics. This canalicular bile amounts to 75% of the approximately 600&#x00A0;mL secreted per day. Cholangiocytes secreting HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O as well as paracellular water influx constitute the remainder and render bile both isotonic and neutral to slightly alkaline. Bile flow ranges from 1.5 to 15&#x00A0;&#x00B5;L/kg/min and reaches the cystic and bile ducts via the hepatic duct. Passive and active resistance at the sphincter of Oddi facilitate gallbladder filling. Duodenal signaling following meal consumption triggers 80% to 100% emptying of the gallbladder. Primary bile acids (chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid) are acted on by resident bacteria to form secondary bile acids (lithocholic acid and deoxycholic acid), with a small fraction of ursodeoxycholic acid also detected.</p>
<p class="indent">The liver performs a remarkable spectrum of metabolic and excretory functions, ranging from nutritional substance uptake from the portal and systemic circulations, to synthesis of various proteins and bile components,<a id="page122"></a> to regulation of circulating nutrients and toxins, to immune host defense.<sup><a href="ch006-sec06.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> Examples of these functions include the following:</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff6-6"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff6-6.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="caption"><span class="fignum">Figure&#160;6.6</span> The figure illustrates the heterogeneity of the structure and function of the biliary tree and bile duct epithelial cells. Canalicular bile secreted by hepatocytes enters the biliary tree by joining upstream with the canals of Hering. As branches of the biliary tree join, the luminal diameter increases (values in parentheses) and the bile duct epithelial cells become larger. The range of receptors and transporters on medium and large bile duct cells is similar although secretin receptor expression and Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> exchange activity is greater in the median and large size bile duct cells.

<ul class="bblue"><li><span><strong><em>Protein synthesis:</em></strong> Most blood proteins (except antibodies) are synthesized in and secreted by the liver, including albumin, the <strong><em>vitamin K&#x2013;dependent coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, and X)</em></strong>, and the <strong><em>vitamin K&#x2013;independent factors (V, XI, XII, and XIII and fibrinogen)</em></strong>. These can be assessed clinically as indirect indicators of hepatic synthetic function. Amino acid synthesis and breakdown also occur in the liver, the latter by transamination and oxidative deamination, with formation of keto acids, ammonia, and glutamine. Disruption of these synthetic functions can be observed in extreme starvation or liver failure, leading to hypoproteinemia, ascites formation, and bleeding disorders.</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Production of cholesterol and lipoproteins:</em></strong> The liver transforms ingested <strong><em>cholesterol</em></strong> and synthesizes various lipoprotein species that act as blood-borne, transportable, emulsified packages that allow transport of essential cell metabolism elements around the body.</span></li>

<li><span><strong><em>Nutrient storage:</em></strong> The liver converts excess glucose into <strong><em>glycogen</em></strong> for storage and blood glucose regulation and also stores <strong><em>fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K)</em></strong> and minerals. As a result, liver failure is often accompanied by profound hypoglycemia.</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Hemoglobin metabolism:</em></strong> The liver processes iron-containing heme (in the form of unconjugated <strong><em>bilirubin</em></strong> generated by erythrocyte destruction and hemoglobin release in the spleen) so that its iron content can by recycled<a id="page124"></a> for various uses. The liver conjugates bilirubin with glucuronic acid to form water-soluble bilirubin that is excreted in bile.</span></li>

The liver is populated by different macrophage populations. The most abundant one is composted by embryonically derived Kupffer cells (KCs) which reside in liver sinusoids and interact mainly with HSC and EC. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMs) can also acquire a KC-like phenotype after inflammation. Liver capsular macrophages (LCMs) are present at the level of the liver capsule (LC). Finally, mature peritoneal macrophages (PMs) can also be recruited in the liver, notably in case of injuries in the parenchyma. EC, endothelial cell; HSC, hepatic stellate cell; Neu, neutrophils.

<li><span><strong><em>Detoxification of drugs and other poisonous substances:</em></strong> On an evolutionary basis, the position of the liver as the first organ to encounter products of intestinal absorption allowed survival in an environment in which plants produced toxins aimed at prohibiting consumption by animals. As the biochemical arms race evolved, the cytochrome apparatus in the liver has become capable of processing an extremely wide array of natural and synthetic substances to less toxic or nontoxic compounds. Nonetheless, some ingested toxins and drugs are capable of causing liver damage, if not liver failure (eg, acetaminophen). Similarly, the endogenous toxin <strong><em>ammonia</em></strong> (absorbed across the intestine or created during hepatic protein metabolism) is converted in the liver to water-soluble urea for subsequent renal excretion. Impaired liver function results in ammonia accumulation and can lead to hepatic encephalopathy.</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Immune host defense:</em></strong> The <strong><em>mononuclear phagocyte system</em></strong> (formerly known as the reticuloendothelial system) comprises multiple cell types distributed across various organs in a coordinated function of host defense, which includes the Kupffer and dendritic cells noted above. Impaired liver function can result in more frequent or severe systemic infections (eg, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). Kupffer cells also lyse erythrocytes into heme and globin components, thereby augmenting splenic release of unconjugated bilirubin into the circulation, where it combines with circulating albumin, eventually returning to the liver for hemoglobin metabolism, as described in the previous section.</span></li></ul>
