<h4 class="h4" id="sec229">IV. Cardiopulmonary Bypass</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine is made up of four basic parts: venous and arterial cannulae to take blood from and back to the heart, a venous reservoir to collect and transiently store the blood drained from the heart, an oxygenator membrane for exchanging carbon dioxide and oxygen, and a pump to propel blood back to the body. The cannula and oxygenator are primed with approximately 800 to 1500&#x00A0;mL of solution that approximates normal plasma osmolarity. When CPB is initiated, this priming volume causes <strong><em>sudden hemodilution</em></strong> of the patient&#x2019;s circulating blood volume and transient <strong><em>hypotension</em></strong>. Blood is drained from the body via the multiorifice venous cannula that is placed into the right atrium and empties blood from the superior and inferior cavae and right atrium. Venous drainage through this cannula occurs passively by gravity siphon and is dependent on proper cannula position and a drop in height from the heart to the venous reservoir. Once in the venous reservoir, blood travels through a semipermeable membrane oxygenator for carbon dioxide and oxygen exchange. The fraction of inspired oxygen, temperature, the flow rate of the inspired gas, and delivery of volatile agents can all be controlled by the CPB machine. After blood leaves the oxygenator, a roller or centrifugal pump propels the blood via the arterial cannula to the proximal ascending aorta for systemic perfusion. <strong><a href="#ff36-2">Figure 36.2</a></strong> illustrates the basic CPB circuit.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Extracorporeal Circulation</strong></p>
<p class="indent">CPB requires systemic <strong><em>anticoagulation</em></strong>, which is usually accomplished by a single intravenous bolus of 300 U/kg of heparin. Anticoagulation is critical to prevent activation of the clotting cascade and clot formation in the CPB machine due to the exposure of blood to CPB circuitry. Activated clotting times (ACT) are checked to confirm adequate anticoagulation (ACT &#x003E; 400 seconds) prior to and during CPB.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen647">A. <a id="page775"></a>Myocardial Protection</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Myocardial protection is accomplished through two mechanisms: (1) the delivery of <strong><em>cardioplegia</em></strong> solution to arrest, electrically silence, and cool the heart and (2) removal of blood from the heart to minimize wall tension. Cardioplegia solution is a cold or tepid, high-potassium-containing blood solution delivered to the coronaries to decrease myocardial oxygen consumption. It can be delivered antegrade through a cannula placed in the proximal aortic root. However, in the presence of aortic insufficiency, severe coronary stenosis, or valvular surgery, cardioplegia is delivered retrograde by placing a cannula through the right atrium into the coronary sinus. Additional cannulae may be needed to remove any air or blood that collects in the LV from the bronchial circulation or the coronary sinus during CPB. This is critical to prevent dilation of the heart resulting in high wall tension and myocardial ischemia. Surgical blood loss during CPB is returned to the venous reservoir via suction cannulae and a &#x201C;cardiotomy&#x201D; reservoir.</p>
