<p class="nonindent">Due to the low complication rate and potential for early ambulation, most uncomplicated laparoscopic procedures (cholecystectomy, gynecologic procedures) in patients with no or very well-controlled comorbidities can be performed on an <strong><em>outpatient basis</em></strong>.<sup><a href="ch027-sec08.xhtml#bib13">13</a></sup> Postoperative hospital admission in these patients is rarely needed unless the procedure is complicated by persistent postoperative nausea and vomiting or inadequate pain control. Safety of outpatient laparoscopic bariatric surgery is controversial because of the high incidence of sleep apnea and postoperative surgical complications. Robot-assisted procedures for radical cancer surgery require postoperative hospital admission or admission to the hospital because of their duration and extensive fluid shifts.</p>
