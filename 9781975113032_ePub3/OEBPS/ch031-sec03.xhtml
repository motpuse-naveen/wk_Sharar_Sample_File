<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Pain</em></strong> is transmitted via different means in different stages of labor. Pain during the first stage of labor, which commences with the beginning of regular contractions and cervical dilation and ends with complete cervical dilation, is transmitted via visceral afferent fibers entering the spinal cord from T10-L1. During the second stage, which begins with complete cervical dilation and ends with delivery of the fetus, additional pain is caused by stretching of vaginal and perineal tissues and is transmitted via sacral somatic fibers. The third stage of labor begins after delivery of the fetus and ends with delivery of the placenta, and pain during this stage is also transmitted via sacral somatic fibers.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Labor Pain Pathways</strong></p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><em>spine</em></strong> has 33 levels: 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, and 4 coccygeal. Skin dermatomal levels correspond to the vertebral level at which their nerve roots enter (<strong><a href="#ff31-3">Figure 31.3</a></strong>). The spinal cord is protected by the bony spine, ligaments, and layers of connective tissue and is bathed in CSF. The spinal cord is covered by three membranes, called the spinal meninges. The outermost layer is the dura mater, deep to the dura is the arachnoid, under the arachnoid layer lies CSF, and the pia mater is adherent to the spinal cord. The spinal cord extends from its inception off the brainstem through the foramen magnum and continues to L1 in most adults. About 10% of adults have spinal cords that terminate lower, at L3. It is therefore prudent to perform neuraxial procedures below this level.</p>

<p class="indent">The spinal cord terminates as the cauda equina and the dural sac extends to S2. The epidural space spans from the foramen magnum to the sacral hiatus. It is a potential space and contains nerve roots, fat, valveless veins, lymphatics, and spinal arteries (<strong><a href="#ff31-4">Figures 31.4</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#ff31-5">31.5</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Neuraxially administered local anesthetics</em></strong> cause blockade of sympathetic, sensory, and motor input and, depending on the dose, can provide analgesia or complete anesthesia. Small, myelinated, rapidly firing, active nerve fibers are more sensitive to local anesthetic blockade than larger, unmyelinated fibers. Degree of blockade from highest to lowest after administration of neuraxial local anesthetic is as follows: temperature sensation, vasomotor tone, sensory, and finally motor. Spinal anesthesia occurs via direct action of local anesthetic on the spinal cord, and block level depends on several factors, of which baricity and dose are the most significant.</p>

<p class="video1" id="vid31-3"><strong>VIDEO 31.3</strong></p>
<p class="video2"><strong>Subarachnoid Block Baricity</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Epidural anesthesia occurs via local anesthetic action on nerve roots and, to a lesser extent, has a direct effect on the spinal cord, via diffusion of local anesthetic into the intrathecal space. Usually 1 to 2&#x00A0;mL of epidural local anesthetic is required per lumbar dermatomal level requiring blockade.</p>
<p class="indent">Neuraxial labor analgesia provides excellent pain relief without effects on fetal or labor outcomes, with the exception of slightly increasing the length of the first and second stages of labor and the risk of instrumented vaginal delivery.<sup><a href="ch031-sec09.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup> Avoiding excessive motor blockade, while still providing adequate analgesia, is ideal in labor. This goal is commonly accomplished by administering low-concentration (0.0625%-0.125% bupivacaine) high-volume, patient-controlled epidural anesthesia (PCEA), with small amounts of opioid in the solutions.</p>

<p class="indent">After history, physical examination, and determination that the patient is a candidate for neuraxial anesthesia (<strong><a href="#tt31-3">Table 31.3</a></strong>), preparation for placement of a neuraxial block begins. A functioning intravenous line, resuscitation equipment, and blood pressure and heart rate monitoring are required, as are sterile precautions including hat, mask, hand hygiene, and sterile gloves.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient is placed in either the sitting or lateral decubitus position, and the desired lumbar level is identified by palpation of the iliac crests and spinous processes. Most neuraxial catheters for labor are placed between L2-3 and L5-S1. After sterilizing the back with an antiseptic and placing a sterile drape, the anesthesiologist places a skin wheal of local anesthesia at the intended needle placement site. Either a midline or paramedian approach to the epidural space is possible. Midline is more common and easier to perform for beginners. Layers traversed by the epidural needle during placement of epidural block include, from superficial to deep, skin, subcutaneous tissue, supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, and ligamentum flavum.</p>

After embedding the needle tip in the ligamentum flavum, a syringe with 2 to 3&#x00A0;mL of saline and an air bubble is attached. The left hand rests securely on the back and the fingers of the left hand grasp the needle firmly. The left hand advances the needle slowly and under control by rotating at the wrist. The fingers of the right hand maintain constant pressure on the syringe plunger but do not aid in advancing the needle. If the needle tip is properly engaged in the ligamentum flavum, it should be possible to compress the air bubble without injecting the saline. As the needle tip enters the epidural space, there will be a sudden loss of resistance and the saline will be suddenly injected.</strong> (From Mulroy MF. <em>Regional Anesthesia: An Illustrated Procedural Guide</em>. 3rd ed. Wolters Kluwer Health; 2002, Figure 34.8.)</figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">The epidural space is a potential space lying deep to the ligamentum flavum. The hollow, large-bore epidural needle with stylet is placed into the superficial ligaments, the stylet is removed, and an air- or saline-filled syringe is attached. The syringe will give tactile resistance when pushed until the ligamentum flavum is traversed, and the epidural space is entered, at which time tactile resistance disappears. Both the thickness of the ligamentum flavum and depth of the epidural space are usually 3 to 5&#x00A0;cm.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the space is entered, saline may be injected to confirm loss of resistance, and the depth at which the epidural space was entered is noted (most epidural needles have centimeter markings on them). A soft catheter is then threaded into the space 3 to 5&#x00A0;cm. A test dose of lidocaine mixed with 15&#x00A0;&#x03BC;g of epinephrine is commonly administered via the catheter to ensure that it is not intravascular or intrathecal. Criteria for a positive intravascular test dose include an increase in heart rate by 20 beats per minute or an increase in systolic blood pressure by 15&#x00A0;mm Hg within 45 seconds of administration. The catheter must be removed and replaced at the same or a different interspace if a positive intravascular test occurs. A profound sensory and motor block within 5 minutes after administration of test dose confirms a positive intrathecal. If an intrathecal catheter is accidentally placed, it may be used for labor analgesia with appropriate dosing or it may be removed and replaced at a <strong><em>different</em></strong> level (<strong><a href="#ff31-6">Figure 31.6</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">Epidural activation begins with an initial bolus of dilute local anesthetic mixed with lipid-soluble opioid, such as 0.125% bupivacaine mixed with fentanyl 50 to 100&#x00A0;&#x03BC;g, given in 5-mL increments, for a total of 10 to 20&#x00A0;mL. Time to analgesia is typically 10 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page658"></a>Alternatively, combined spinal epidural (CSE) analgesia has gained popularity because time to initial analgesia is shorter.<sup><a href="ch031-sec09.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup> Placement resembles an epidural procedure, except that once the epidural space has been located, a long, small-gauge, noncutting spinal needle is inserted through the epidural needle. Then an intrathecal dose of lipid-soluble opioid, such as fentanyl or sufentanil, with or without a low dose of local anesthetic, is administered. The clinician commonly administers a test dose, but no epidural bolus is necessary, and time to analgesia is typically &#x003C;5 minutes. Postdural puncture headache risk is not increased, and the risk of epidural failure may be <strong><em>lower</em></strong> with CSE, although data yield conflicting results.<sup><a href="ch031-sec09.xhtml#bib3">3</a>,<a href="ch031-sec09.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> A CSE technique may result in increased rates of fetal bradycardia and pruritus. Dural puncture epidural (DPE) is a relatively newer technique. The dura is punctured with a small gauge spinal needle, just as it is during a CSE; however, no medicine is administered into the intrathecal space, and instead, medication is infused through the epidural catheter. This technique produces a marginally faster sensory blockade when compared to epidural alone with less unilateral analgesia and more reliable sacral coverage for the second stage of labor without the potential adverse effects of the CSE technique.<sup><a href="ch031-sec09.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">If an intrathecal catheter is placed, the dose is about one-tenth the volume of a typical epidural dose, administered either as a continuous infusion or via intermittent <strong><em>provider-administered</em></strong> bolus every 1 to 2 hours. The patient&#x2019;s nurse and any subsequent providers must be notified that the catheter is intrathecal, and both the catheter and pump must be clearly labeled so that accidental overdose does not occur.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of ultrasound guidance for placement of neuraxial catheters is becoming more common and can be useful in obese patients or for patients with spinal abnormalities. Location of midline, accurate assessment of lumbar level, and measurement of depth of the epidural and intrathecal spaces are all possible via ultrasound.</p>
