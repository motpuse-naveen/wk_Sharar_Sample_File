<h5 class="h5" id="sen540">A. Monitoring</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Standard ASA monitors are described in <a href="ch015.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>. In emergencies, the oxygen saturation monitor can provide reasonably accurate heart rate and oxygen saturation information. A poor quality waveform may also suggest poor peripheral perfusion. An arterial line can provide accurate beat-to-beat measurement of blood pressure and facilitate frequent blood sampling. It can also be used to estimate cardiac output and intravascular volume status (see <a href="ch023.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>). Placement of an arterial line, however, should never delay the start of an emergent hemostatic procedure. In severe cases of hemorrhagic shock, the end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> waveform can be a sensitive indicator for hypoperfusion, as reduced venous return will result in diminished cardiac output and a reduction in end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>. A sudden and significant drop of end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> in the hypotensive trauma patient is often a sign of imminent cardiovascular collapse.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen541">B. Anesthetic and Adjunct Drugs</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Medications should be selected depending on the patient&#x2019;s mental status, injuries, and hemodynamic status. Severely injured patients with hypovolemia are very susceptible to the negative inotropic and vasodilatory effects of anesthetics, particularly certain induction drugs (eg, propofol) and volatile anesthetics. Thus, all anesthetic drugs should be slowly and carefully titrated to avoid cardiovascular collapse in such patients. Unconscious trauma patients may not require much, if any, sedative drugs for tracheal intubation, but will benefit from muscle relaxation to facilitate the intubation. Similarly, hypovolemic yet conscious patients will usually require a significantly reduced dose of anesthetic and benefit from medications such as etomidate or ketamine, which provide better blood pressure stability than propofol. A partial list of commonly used perioperative anesthetic and adjunct drugs, along with specific cautions for use in trauma patients, is provided in <strong><a href="#tt32-3">Table 32.3</a></strong>.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen542">C. Induction and Airway Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Rapid sequence induction (RSI)</em></strong> is the process of intravenous induction of general anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade, after which an endotracheal tube is rapidly placed to secure the airway. This is done with limited positive pressure mask ventilation to minimizing the risk of regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents (see <a href="ch020.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>). RSI is commonly employed in trauma patients. Usually combined with MILS in patients at risk for cervical SCI, it is a safe and effective method to secure the airway. If a hard cervical collar is in place, the front portion of the collar can be removed, with MILS applied immediately after induction to facilitate mouth opening and laryngeal viewing.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Whereas rapid sequence induction and intubation is generally a two-person procedure, a minimum of three providers are required when performing the procedure in a patient with possible cervical spine injury: one to hold manual in-line neck stabilization, one to provide cricoid pressure, and one to perform tracheal intubation.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong><em>Video laryngoscopy (VL)</em></strong> is increasingly used for emergency airway management. Evidence suggests that VL can improve visualization of the vocal cords and increase the intubation success rate in predicted difficult airway cases (eg, limited mouth opening, higher Mallampati scores). Compared to conventional direct laryngoscopy it also requires less manipulation of the cervical spine. However, it tends to be a slower technique and might not improve the intubation success rate in routine cases.<sup><a href="ch032-sec05.xhtml#bib6">6</a></sup> Supraglottic airways (eg, laryngeal mask) provide a blind insertion alternative to tracheal intubation. In the prehospital setting, such devices may be easier to place by providers with limited intubation experience. In the hospital setting, they serve as effective rescue devices in &#x201C;can&#x2019;t intubate, can&#x2019;t ventilate&#x201D; scenarios; however, they do not provide reliable protection against aspiration.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen543">D. <a id="page688"></a>Hypotension</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hypotension in trauma patients is to be considered of hemorrhagic origin until proven otherwise. While moderate amounts of blood loss can be replaced with crystalloid infusion, more severe blood loss or ongoing hemorrhage will require blood transfusion.</p>
<p class="indent">Patients with traumatic injures require adequate intravenous access to allow rapid volume resuscitation. Ideally, severely injured patients should have central venous access with a large-bore sheath introducer (eg, Cordis, Cardinal Health Inc, Dublin, Ohio) or peripheral venous access via a large-bore rapid infusion catheter. Avoiding long IV tubing or tubing extensions (&#x201C;pig tails&#x201D;) is also recommended, as they will limit the infusion flow rate. For abdominal injuries, IV access is placed preferably in the upper extremities or neck. In case of femoral or iliac vein injury, access in the lower extremity, including femoral line, can cause transfused blood or fluids to flow into the abdomen instead of the central circulation.</p>
<p class="indent">Resuscitation is often initiated with warm isotonic crystalloid, such as Plasma-Lyte or lactated Ringer&#x2019;s. Sodium chloride 0.9% should be avoided because of its associated risk of acute kidney injury (see <a href="ch023.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>). ATLS currently recommends initiation of 1&#x00A0;L of crystalloid (20&#x00A0;mL/kg for pediatric patients) and early conversion to blood products for unresponsive shock.</p>
<p class="indent">Before the bleeding source has been controlled, <strong><em>damage control resuscitation (DCR)</em></strong> is a useful strategy to reduce blood loss and limit coagulopathy in massively bleeding patients. Aside from early hemorrhage control, DCR focuses on three tenets: permissive hypotension, limiting crystalloid use, and hemostatic resuscitation.</p>
<p class="indent">The concept of <strong><em>permissive hypotension</em></strong> aims to mitigate blood loss by allowing a lower-than-normal blood pressure&#x2014;just enough to provide vital organ perfusion&#x2014;until source control of hemorrhage is achieved. In patients without TBI, a target SBP of 80 to 90&#x00A0;mm Hg (MAP 50-60&#x00A0;mm Hg) is generally recommended.<sup><a href="ch032-sec05.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup> Concurrently, crystalloids and colloids are avoided to prevent dilution of coagulation factors, and <strong><em>&#x201C;hemostatic resuscitation&#x201D;</em></strong> is performed with aggressive use of hemostatic blood products combined with packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to prevent and reverse coagulopathy. Early use of PRBCs and empiric administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets before a documented coagulopathy has improved survival of severely injured trauma patients in both the combat environment and the civilian population.<sup><a href="ch032-sec05.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup> The general goal is a ratio of PRBCs to FFP to platelets approaching 1:1:1, or when circumstances permit, a goal-directed transfusion using point-of-care viscoelastic monitoring.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Tranexamic acid (TXA)</em></strong> is a synthetic lysine analogue that inhibits fibrinolysis. Its administration within 3 hours after injury has been shown to reduce mortality in major trauma patients<sup><a href="ch032-sec05.xhtml#bib9">9</a></sup> and is increasingly used in this setting.</p>
<p class="indent">Hypotension during trauma surgery is most commonly caused by hemorrhage and hypovolemia with compensatory peripheral vasoconstriction, in contrast to hypotension in nontrauma patients that is often caused by <a id="page689"></a>vasodilation from anesthetic drugs. Therefore, hypotensive trauma patients should be treated with volume replacement instead of vasopressors. The use of vasopressors (with the possible exception of vasopressin) is associated with increased mortality in trauma resuscitation, and their use should be avoided.<sup><a href="ch032-sec05.xhtml#bib10">10</a></sup> However, vasopressors can be used to bridge a short amount of time if blood products are not immediately available for transfusion or to limit excessive crystalloid resuscitation. In case of imminent cardiovascular collapse due to blood loss in a trauma patient, small doses of epinephrine (50-200 &#x00B5;g) can stabilize the blood pressure and allow time for further volume resuscitation. Larger doses of epinephrine might increase the blood pressure significantly, however, and rapidly result in increased blood loss.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen544">E. Hypothermia</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong><em>&#x201C;lethal triad&#x201D; of trauma resuscitation</em></strong> consists of hypothermia, coagulopathy, and acidosis. To avoid hypothermia in perioperative trauma care, the operating room should be heated to as warm a temperature as possible, intravenous fluids warmed, and convective warming devices used to maintain a core temperature &#x003E; 36 &#x00B0;C.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Hypocapnia</strong></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen545">F. Coagulation Abnormalities</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Trauma-induced coagulopathy</em></strong> is an endogenous impairment of the coagulation system that occurs early after injury. It is found in at least a quarter of severely injured patient and is associated with at least 2-fold increase in mortality. Thus, accurate assessment of and correction of coagulation status are very important components of trauma resuscitation. Traditionally, blood samples are sent for prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (INR), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), hemoglobin (Hb)/hematocrit, platelet count, and fibrinogen. Low platelet counts, Hb, and fibrinogen are treated with platelets, PRBCs, and cryoprecipitate, respectively. Elevated INR and PTT are treated with FFP. However, these tests are neither timely nor particularly sensitive and specific, thereby limiting their use in acute resuscitation.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Viscoelastic testing</em></strong>, such as <strong><em>thromboelastography (TEG)</em></strong> and <strong><em>rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM),</em></strong> has been increasingly used as a point-of-care test to evaluate various functional aspects of coagulation (<strong><a href="#ff32-4">Figures 32.4</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#ff32-5">32.5</a></strong>) in trauma patients. TEG/ROTEM readout can be divided into three phases, each answering different questions about clot formation. Phase 1 is the preclot formation phase. It shows &#x201C;how long&#x201D; it takes for clot formation to start. Prolongation of this phase is treated with FFP or prothrombin complex concentrate. Phase 2 is the clot formation phase, answering &#x201C;how strong&#x201D; the clot strength is. This reflects fibrinogen level and platelet mass. A shallow clot angle and amplitude can be treated with platelet, cryoprecipitate, or fibrinogen concentrate transfusion. Lastly, the clot stability phase indicates the status of fibrinolysis. Abnormalities in this phase can be treated with antifibrinolytics such as TXA.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen546">G. Electrolyte and Acid-Base Disturbances</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Massive transfusion can cause several metabolic abnormalities. Citrate preservative in both PRBCs and FFP can chelate and decrease the serum calcium level, thereby contributing to hypotension. <strong><em>Hypocalcemia</em></strong> is associated with increased mortality; therefore ionized calcium levels below 1&#x00A0;mmol/L or persistent hypotension with blood transfusion should be promptly treated with calcium chloride.</p>
<p class="indent">Lysis of red blood cells during transfusion can result in <strong><em>hyperkalemia</em></strong>, particularly with older blood products. Hyperkalemia is characterized by peaked T waves on the electrocardiogram. Potassium levels &#x003E;5 mEq/L should be treated with calcium chloride to stabilize cardiac membrane potentials. Insulin with or without dextrose can also be administered to drive potassium into the cell and lower the serum potassium level; however, blood glucose should be frequently monitored.</p>
