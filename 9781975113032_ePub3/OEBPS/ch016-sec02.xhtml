<h5 class="h5" id="sen232">A. Cardiovascular Disease</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Cardiac Risk Assessment</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Cardiovascular complications are a significant source of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Therefore, identifying patients at risk for these complications and finding ways to mitigate these risks preoperatively is a major objective of the preanesthetic workup. The risk of a perioperative major adverse cardiac event (MACE) or death is related to patient factors and the planned surgery. Several validated risk prediction tools have been developed to estimate risk. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) is among the most popular. Based on a retrospective review of over 4000 patients presenting for noncardiac surgery, this index identified six independent predictors of cardiac complications: history of ischemic heart disease; history of congestive heart failure; history of stroke of transient ischemic attack (TIA); preoperative insulin-requiring diabetes; creatinine &#x003E;2.0&#x00A0;mg/dL; and those presenting for high-risk surgery (intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular surgery). Two or greater of these factors predict elevated risk. Two newer risk tools have been created by the American College of Surgeon&#x2019;s National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). These incorporate additional factors such as age and functional status. NSQIP has used the information from these tools to create calculators that estimate the risk of MACE and death based on the value of the input variables<sup>b</sup>.</p>
<p class="indent">Regarding preoperative testing, baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) is reasonable in patients with known ischemic vascular disease (ie, coronary artery, cerebrovascular or peripheral artery disease, significant arrhythmias, or major structural heart disease). Age triggers for ECG vary from institution to institution, as do acceptable time intervals from the last ECG in an otherwise stable patient. In general, preoperative noninvasive cardiac stress testing should be reserved for patients with elevated cardiac risk who demonstrate poor (&#x003C;4 METs) or unknown functional capacity and are undergoing anything other than low-risk surgery (MACE risk &#x2265;1%).</p>
<p class="indent">Regarding the decision to undertake coronary revascularization before surgery, the Coronary Artery Revascularization Prophylaxis (CARP) trial was the first large, randomized study designed to evaluate whether prophylactic coronary revascularization prior to major vascular surgery reduced perioperative cardiac events relative to optimal pharmacologic management. The main finding was no difference in all-cause mortality at a median follow-up of <a id="page344"></a>2.7&#x00A0;years. A secondary finding was no difference in the incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction. A criticism that has been rendered against the CARP trial was that selection criteria resulted in the exclusion of too many high-risk patients. However, for the majority of patients, current evidence supports pharmacologic optimization as the best cardiac risk reduction strategy prior to surgery. The 2014 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association &#x201C;Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation and Management of Patients Undergoing Noncardiac Surgery&#x201D; guideline presents an algorithmic approach to perioperative cardiac assessment aimed at helping clinicians in the evaluation of these patients (<strong><a href="#ff16-1">Figure 16.1</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch016-sec06.xhtml#bib19">19</a>,<a href="ch016-sec06.xhtml#bib20">20</a></sup></p>
<h6 class="h6">Perioperative Coronary Stents</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with indwelling coronary stents, especially those that have been inserted recently, present a treatment dilemma, as these patients are frequently on lifelong antiplatelet therapy to prevent in-stent thrombosis. Information that should be obtained during the preanesthetic interview includes the type of stent, time since placement, and input from the consulting cardiologist as to whether antiplatelet therapy can be discontinued in the perioperative period. Current recommendations from the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology call for postponing elective surgery for a minimum of 4&#x00A0;weeks after placement of a BMS and 6&#x00A0;months after placement of a DES (<strong><a href="#ff16-2">Figure 16.2</a></strong>). Time-sensitive surgeries can be considered only after at least 3&#x00A0;months of DAPT after DES placement, with the risks and benefits considered by both the cardiology and surgery teams. If possible, DAPT, or at least aspirin, should be continued throughout the perioperative period.</p>

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline calls for stepwise cardiac risk assessment involving consideration of the patient&#x2019;s cardiac risk factors, functional capacity, and the planned surgical procedure. If emergent, surgery should proceed and cardiac risk be mitigated with appropriate intraoperative monitoring and pharmacologic techniques. If surgery is nonemergent and an acute coronary syndrome (eg, unstable angina) is identified, surgery should be delayed and the patient should receive appropriate medical treatment. In general, during preanesthetic evaluation, all patients should receive a cardiac risk assessment using a validated risk tool (RCRI or NSQIP risk calculator). If the risk of MACE is &#x2265;1% and the patient&#x2019;s functional capacity is &#x2265;4 METs, no further testing is indicated. If, however, the risk of MACE is &#x2265;1% and the patient&#x2019;s functional capacity is &#x003C;4 METs or unknown, pharmacological stress testing should be considered. If the result is abnormal, consideration may be given to PCI or CABG. Pharmacological stress testing is not advised for patients undergoing low-risk surgery (MACE &#x003C;1%). In addition, pharmacological stress testing should only be undertaken if it is expected to change management. An alternative to stress testing is guideline-directed medical therapy, for example, <em>&#x03B2;</em>-blockers and statins.

<a id="page347"></a>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The risk of electromagnetic interference (EMI) affecting the function of a cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) decreases as the distance of the procedure from the CIED increases. For patients having surgery below the umbilicus, surgery may safely proceed without alteration of the CIED or the application of a magnet.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Patients With CIEDs</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with CIEDs are presenting for surgery with increasing frequency, as the indications for these devices increase and the population ages. Traditionally, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy has been delivered via transvenous systems which deliver shock therapy via intracardiac leads. More recently, subcutaneous ICD systems have been developed. These systems consist of a pulse generator and a single subcutaneous lead which senses, detects, and delivers treatment when a life-threatening dysrhythmia is detected. Unlike the transvenous systems, subcutaneous ICD systems must be placed in the right chest.</p>
<p class="indent">EMI from devices in the operating suite&#x2014;most commonly monopolar electrocautery&#x2014;can cause malfunction of these devices. Subcutaneous systems may be even more susceptible to this interference. Specifically, EMI may be interpreted as intrinsic cardiac activity and thereby lead to inappropriate antitachycardia therapy (defibrillation or pacing). In 2011, the Heart Rhythm Society and the ASA published a consensus statement in collaboration with the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and Society of Thoracic Surgeons to provide guidance on the perioperative management of these devices.<sup><a href="ch016-sec06.xhtml#bib21">21</a></sup> In 2020, the ASA published similar guidelines.<sup><a href="ch016-sec06.xhtml#bib22">22</a></sup> Essential information that should be obtained about the CIED during the anesthesia evaluation includes the reason for device implantation, device type and manufacturer, date of last interrogation and report, current programming, whether the patient is pacemaker dependent, and the device&#x2019;s response to application of a magnet (<strong><a href="#tt16-11">Table 16.11</a></strong>). For most ICDs, external application of a magnet will disable tachycardic therapy but will have no effect on pacemaker settings. This is also true of the subcutaneous systems. Magnet application to a pacemaker will initiate asynchronous pacing.</p>
<p class="indent">Surgical aspects should also be considered, including accessibility of the pulse generator for magnet application and removal and the risk of EMI. A separation of the monopolar cautery current path and device pulse generator and leads of at least 6 in (15&#x00A0;cm) has traditionally been thought to be the distance at which EMI is unlikely. Practically, surgery below the umbilicus is very unlikely to cause EMI for devices implanted in the upper chest. If monopolar cautery is required, the dispersion pad should be placed to direct current as far from the generator and leads as possible. If EMI is deemed likely, permanent pacemaker function should be altered to an asynchronous mode, particularly in the pacemaker-dependent patient. The antitachycardia function of a defibrillator should be suspended. This can be accomplished by application of a magnet or device reprogramming. Note that in some devices, the magnet response asynchronous ventricular rate for some devices is as high as 100 bpm, which may not be desirable for some patients. In any case, there should be a very low threshold to seek advice on perioperative CIED management from the managing cardiology team. Pacemakers should have been interrogated within 12&#x00A0;months and defibrillators within 6&#x00A0;months of contemplated surgery. <strong><a href="#tt16-11">Table 16.11</a></strong> presents an approach to the perioperative management of the patient with a CIED.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Hypertension</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hypertension is highly prevalent, with over 40% of adults in the United States carrying the diagnosis. From a perioperative perspective, the main concerns in the hypertensive patient are the presence of hypertensive end-organ damage <a id="page348"></a>and overall cardiovascular risk. Induction of anesthesia results in sympathetic stimulation that manifests as a rise in blood pressure of about 20 to 30&#x00A0;mm Hg and heart rate of about 15 to 20 bpm. This response is exaggerated in patients with preexisting hypertension, especially those who are untreated or poorly controlled. Patients with undiagnosed hypertension are also more likely to exhibit intraoperative blood pressure lability.</p>

<p class="indent">Whether to postpone elective surgery in patients with poorly controlled hypertension is controversial. Some anesthesiologists postpone elective surgery in patients who exhibit a sustained systolic blood pressure of &#x003E;180&#x00A0;mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of &#x003E;110&#x00A0;mm Hg or who have signs or symptoms of unrecognized or untreated end-organ damage. The concern in these cases would be an increased risk of perioperative complications including dysrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, neurologic complications, and kidney injury.<sup><a href="ch016-sec06.xhtml#bib23">23</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen233">B. Pulmonary Disease</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Postoperative pulmonary complications occur in an estimated 5% to 10% of surgeries and may account for as many as one in four deaths that occur within 1&#x00A0;week of surgery.<sup><a href="ch016-sec06.xhtml#bib24">24</a></sup> The risk of their occurrence is related to both patient and surgical factors (<strong><a href="#tt16-12">Table 16.12</a></strong>). What constitutes a pulmonary complication is not well defined, but it is generally taken to mean any clinically significant pulmonary dysfunction that adversely affects a patient&#x2019;s clinical course. Examples include pneumonia, pneumonitis, hypoventilation, hypoxemia, prolonged mechanical ventilation, reintubation, exacerbation of underlying lung disease, and bronchospasm.</p>
<p class="indent">If pulmonary function testing exists, it is useful to consider the risk stratification often employed prior to thoracic surgery. This includes an assessment of (1) respiratory mechanics (ie, forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]); (2) cardiopulmonary reserve (ie, maximum oxygen consumption [VO<sub>2max</sub>], as approximated by METs); and (3) gas exchange (ie, diffusing capacity, DLCO). <a id="page349"></a>An FEV1 &#x003C; 40%, DLCO &#x003C; 40%, and VO<sub>2max</sub>&#x00A0;&#x003C;&#x00A0;4 METs all predict an increased risk of pulmonary complications.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Patient Factors</h6>
<p class="nonindent">As expected, patients with preexisting lung disease, including obstructive diseases, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and restrictive diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, have an increased risk of pulmonary complications compared with healthy adults. Various risk indices have been created to predict postoperative pulmonary complications. One such index is the ARISCAT (Assess Respiratory Risk in Surgical Patients in Catalonia), which includes the following factors: advanced age; low preoperative oxygen saturation; recent (&#x003C;1&#x00A0;month) respiratory infection, preoperative anemia, or upper abdominal or thoracic surgery; surgery duration &#x003E; 2 hours; and emergency surgery.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Smoking</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Tobacco and nicotine increase sputum production, reduce ciliary function, stimulate the cardiovascular system, and increase carboxyhemoglobin levels. Although smoking cessation for as little as 2&#x00A0;days decreases carboxyhemoglobin levels and improves mucociliary clearance, most studies suggest it takes at least 8&#x00A0;weeks of smoking cessation to reduce the rate of postoperative pulmonary complications. Nevertheless, it is still reasonable to encourage smoking cessation preoperatively owing to its positive implications on a patient&#x2019;s overall health.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The majority of people with OSA are undiagnosed.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Obstructive Sleep Apnea</h6>
<p class="nonindent">OSA is a syndrome marked by periodic upper airway obstruction during sleep, which leads to oxygen desaturation and carbon dioxide retention, sleep deprivation, and daytime somnolence. The prevalence of OSA is estimated to be 10% to 15% in women and 10% to 30% in men. Patients with OSA are particularly susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of inhaled anesthetics and opioids and, therefore, are more likely to suffer critical respiratory events. Patients with OSA have an approximately threefold risk of perioperative complications including difficult mask ventilation and airway management; systemic and pulmonary hypertension; cardiac dysrhythmias; coronary artery disease; delirium; and postoperative respiratory failure and reintubation.<sup><a href="ch016-sec06.xhtml#bib25">25</a></sup> For these reasons, screening for OSA is an important part of the preanesthetic examination. There are a number of screening tools used to evaluate for the presence of OSA, including the STOP-Bang questionnaire and one published by the ASA (<strong><a href="#tt16-13">Table 16.13</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch016-sec06.xhtml#bib26">26</a></sup> Symptoms suggestive of OSA include a history of snoring, daytime sleepiness, and headaches. Physical signs include body mass index &#x003E;35&#x00A0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, neck circumference &#x003E;17 in in men or &#x003E;16 in in women, and tonsillar hyperplasia.</p>
<p class="indent">Preoperative and postoperative use of continuous positive airway pressure or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation have been shown to reduce serious perioperative complications. These patients should receive postoperative respiratory monitoring in a setting with continuous pulse oximetry. When contemplating outpatient surgery, the perioperative team should consider the sleep apnea severity, relevant comorbidities, nature of surgery, expectations of postoperative opioid requirements, patient age, and patient support structure at home. If outpatient surgery is planned, discharge should be delayed until postoperative respiratory function has returned to baseline. Opioid use should be minimized in favor of nonnarcotic analgesics and regional anesthetic techniques.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Surgical Factors</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The site of surgery is the most important factor related to the risk of developing pulmonary complications postoperatively. Patients having thoracic and upper abdominal surgeries are far more likely to suffer pulmonary complications relative to those having lower abdominal or extremity procedures. Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, head and neck surgery, and neurosurgical procedures are also associated with a higher risk of pulmonary complications relative to other surgeries. This is related mostly to effects on the muscles of the upper airway, accessory respiratory muscles, and diaphragmatic function. Duration of surgery is also important, with longer procedures leading to a higher risk of complications. General anesthesia is associated with a higher rate of clinically significant pulmonary complications relative to neuraxial or regional anesthesia.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen234">C. Endocrine Disease</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Diabetes Mellitus</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Diabetes is the most common endocrinopathy, affecting nearly 10% of the population. Patients with diabetes have an accelerated rate of atherosclerosis and are susceptible to microvascular complications that manifest as <a id="page351"></a>retinopathy, neuropathy, cerebrovascular, peripheral vascular, and kidney diseases. Autonomic neuropathy may predispose those with diabetes to intraoperative hemodynamic instability. Gastroparesis increases the risk of pulmonary aspiration. Poorly controlled diabetic patients are also at greater risk of developing postoperative infections.</p>
<p class="indent">Factors including preoperative fasting and the surgical stress response result in large swings in blood glucose levels perioperatively, which make tight glucose control extremely challenging. Overly aggressive glycemic control introduces the risk of life-threatening hypoglycemia, which can go unrecognized under anesthesia. Therefore, in general, guidelines recommend a perioperative glycemic target between 140 and 180&#x00A0;mg/dL.<sup><a href="ch016-sec06.xhtml#bib27">27</a>-<a href="ch016-sec06.xhtml#bib29">29</a></sup> Recommendations for preoperative management of oral hypoglycemics and insulin regimens vary by institution. <strong><a href="ch016-sec01.xhtml#tt16-5">Table 16.5</a></strong> presents a suggested approach.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Thyroid and Parathyroid Disorders</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hypothyroidism is more common in women; signs and symptoms include bradycardia, cold intolerance, hypoventilation, and hyponatremia. Hyperthyroidism is marked by tachycardia, tremor, weight loss, and heat intolerance. Patients may also exhibit dysrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. In symptomatic patients, it may be prudent to delay elective surgery. In addition, thyroid masses may cause distortion of upper airway anatomy. A computed tomography scan of the neck is often useful to evaluate the upper airway and identify tracheal deviation or compression.</p>
<p class="indent">The overall prevalence of hyperparathyroidism is about 1%, but the prevalence increases with advancing age. Symptoms include weight loss, polydipsia, hypertension, heart block, lethargy, bone pain, kidney stones, and constipation. In patients with suspected hyperparathyroidism, preoperative determination of serum calcium concentration is prudent.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Adrenal Disorders</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Pheochromocytoma,</em></strong> though rare, should be considered in any patient who relates a history of paroxysmal hypertension, headache, and tachycardia. The preoperative evaluation should assess for end-organ damage. Preoperative pharmacologic preparation prior to surgery varies but typically includes combined alpha-blockade followed by <em>&#x03B2;</em>-blockade, intended to reduce intra- and postoperative hemodynamic instability and arrhythmias. Invasive cardiovascular monitoring and central venous access may be indicated.</p>
<p class="indent">Adrenal suppression should be considered in any patient who has taken steroids chronically in a dose equivalent to prednisone &#x2265;5&#x00A0;mg/d for at least 3&#x00A0;weeks within 6 to 12&#x00A0;months of surgery. Patients taking a daily prednisone dose &#x2265;20&#x00A0;mg for at least 3&#x00A0;weeks are considered to be suppressed. Patients taking intermediate doses are at intermediate risk of adrenal suppression. Regimens for steroid supplementation perioperatively vary by institution. For minor surgeries, supplementation is rarely needed. For major procedures, one option is to administer 100&#x00A0;mg of hydrocortisone intravenously prior to induction of anesthesia and then 50&#x00A0;mg intravenously every 8 hours for 24 hours (<strong><a href="ch016-sec01.xhtml#tt16-4">Table 16.4</a></strong>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Other Organ Systems and Conditions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with <strong><em>rheumatoid arthritis</em></strong> <strong><em>(</em></strong><strong><em>RA</em></strong><strong><em>)</em></strong> have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease compared with the general population. In addition, they are prone to cervical joint instability, which must be taken into consideration during<a id="page352"></a> intubation. Patients are often maintained on long-term glucocorticoid therapy and may require supplementation perioperatively. Biologic agents used to treat RA may adversely affect the immune response and may predispose patients to perioperative infectious complications and poor wound healing. Surgery is ideally planned to occur just before the patient is due for the next dose to minimize wound complications. Patients with significant osteoarthritis or osteoporosis should be positioned with care, as should patients with indwelling artificial joints.</p>
<p class="indent">Various neurologic conditions have implications for anesthesia and surgery. For patients with a history of seizures, antiepileptic medications should be continued in the perioperative period and drug levels should be carefully monitored, as surgery and no food by mouth status may affect drug absorption and metabolism. Patients with Parkinson disease have an increased risk of orthostatic hypotension, aspiration, and postoperative pulmonary complications. Drugs used to treat Parkinson disease should be continued perioperatively in an attempt to reduce symptom exacerbation. Patients with a history of stroke are at increased risk of perioperative stroke. Patients with spinal injury and denervation, such as quadriplegia or a history of significant burn injuries, are at risk for hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest if given succinylcholine.</p>
<p class="indent">Risk factors suggestive of liver disease include a history of heavy alcohol use, hepatitis, illicit drug use, or sexual promiscuity. Signs on examination include increased abdominal girth, spider telangiectasias, jaundice, gynecomastia, and splenomegaly. Signs of renal disease may be difficult to identify on examination but include hypertension, edema, and lethargy. Of note, patients who are dialysis dependent should ideally be dialyzed within 24 hours of surgery to optimize volume and metabolic status.</p>
<p class="indent">Obesity is increasingly common, affecting approximately 40% of the US population. Obesity creates challenges for the perioperative care team in nearly every respect; notably, it increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, restrictive lung disease, atelectasis, sleep apnea, challenging IV access, difficult mask ventilation and intubation, reactive airway disease, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, liver disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), venous thrombosis, and nerve injury.</p>
