<h5 class="h5" id="sen94">A. Modeling From Concentration to Effect</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pharmacodynamics focuses on the quantitative analysis of the relationship between the plasma drug concentration and effect. The mathematical models for pharmacodynamics are created by measuring the plasma drug concentrations that are required to generate defined drug effects.</p>
<a id="page139"></a>
<h6 class="h6">1. Combined PK-PD Models</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Even though the distribution of any administered drug is a complex biological process, plasma and organ concentrations can often be estimated accurately with simplified models. These models express the time course of drug in the body using a small number of mathematically computed pharmacokinetic parameters. By designing a pharmacokinetic model that also predicts the concentration of the drug at its effect site, it becomes possible to apply the model to address clinically important questions, such as the following:</p>
<ul class="bblue"><li><span>Understanding the distribution of the drug from the central compartment (plasma) to various organs.</span></li>
<li><span>Estimating the time to onset and offset of drug effect.</span></li>
<li><span>Correlating plasma drug concentration and response.</span></li>
<li><span>Predicting the concentration of the drug in various tissues and body fluids.</span></li>
<li><span>Determining the optimum drug dosing to avoid side effects or toxicity in a particular patient population.</span></li>
<li><span>Designing a device dosing algorithm for an infusion regimen using an infusion pump.</span></li>
<li><span>Determining the effect of altered physiologic states and disease processes on drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination, so improving safety profile of drug dosing in these conditions.</span></li>
<li><span>Understanding drug interactions when multiple drugs are coadministered.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Combined PK-PD models fully characterize the relationships between time, dose, plasma concentration, and pharmacologic effect. This is achieved by adding an &#x201C;effect compartment&#x201D; to the standard compartmental PK model.<sup><a href="ch007-sec03.xhtml#bib9">9</a></sup> (See <a href="ch011-sec03.xhtml#ff11-3">Figure 11.3</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The rate constant for drug removal from the effect site, which relates the concentration in the central compartment to the pharmacologic effect, is <em>k</em><sub>e0</sub>. The rate of equilibration between the plasma and the effect site, <em>k</em><sub>e0</sub>, can also be characterized by the half-life of effect site equilibration (<em>t</em><sub>1/2,</sub><em><sub>k</sub></em><sub>e0</sub>) using the formula:</p>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/139-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="indent"><em>t</em><sub>1/2,</sub><em><sub>k</sub></em><sub>e0</sub> is the time for the effect site concentration to reach 50% of the plasma concentration when the plasma concentration is held constant. For anesthetics with a short <em>t</em><sub>1/2,</sub><em><sub>k</sub></em><sub>e0</sub> (ie, high <em>k</em><sub>e0</sub>), equilibration between the plasma and the effect site is rapid, and therefore, there is little delay before an effect is reached when a bolus of drug is administered, or an infusion of drug is initiated.</p>
<h6 class="h6">2. Drug-Receptor Interactions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Drugs produce their effect by binding to receptors, affecting a change in cellular function. These receptors can be on the cell membrane, in the cytoplasm, or in the nucleoplasm. The binding of drugs to receptors, like the binding of drugs to plasma proteins, is usually reversible and follows the Law of Mass Action:</p>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/139-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="indent">The higher the concentration of free drug or unoccupied receptor, the greater the tendency to form the drug-receptor complex. The relation between drug concentration and the intensity of the response is most often characterized by a curvilinear relation (<strong><a href="#ff7-4">Figure 7.4</a></strong>). For most drugs, there is a minimum concentration that needs to be achieved before an effect can be observed (therapeutic<a id="page140"></a> threshold). Once a pharmacologic effect is produced, small increases in drug concentration usually produce relatively large increases in drug effect. As the drug effect reaches near maximum, increases in concentration produce minimal changes in effect.</p>

In the left panel, the response data are plotted against the dose data on a linear scale. In the right panel, the same response data are plotted against the dose data on a logarithmic scale yielding a sigmoid dose-response curve that is linear between 20% and 80% of the maximal effect. Plotting the percentage of receptors occupied by a drug against the logarithm of the concentration of the drug yields a sigmoid curve. (From Gupta DK, Henthorn TK. Basic principles of clinical pharmacology. In: Barash PG, Cahalan MK, Cullen BF, et al, eds. <em>Clinical Anesthesia</em>. 8th ed. Wolters Kluwer; 2018:241-275, Figure 11.9.)</figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Drugs that combine to their receptor and produce maximal effect are termed &#x201C;full agonists&#x201D;; those which produce less than the maximum effect are called &#x201C;partial agonists&#x201D;; and those that do not produce any effect at all are termed &#x201C;antagonists.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Competitive antagonists bind reversibly to receptors, and their blocking effect can be overcome by high concentrations of an agonist (ie, competition). They produce a parallel shift in the dose-response curve, but the maximum effect is not altered (<strong><a href="#ff7-5">Figure 7.5</a></strong>, curves A and B). Noncompetitive antagonists bind irreversibly to receptors and shift the dose-response curve downward and to the right, decreasing both the slope and the maximum effect (<strong><a href="#ff7-5">Figure 7.5</a></strong>, curves A and C). The effect of noncompetitive antagonists is reversed only by synthesis of new receptor molecules. As shown in <strong><a href="#ff7-5">Figure 7.5</a></strong>, drug A produces a maximum effect, <em>E</em><sub>max</sub>, and a 50% of maximal effect at dose or concentration <em>E</em><sub>50,A</sub>. Drug B, a full agonist, can produce the maximum effect, <em>E</em><sub>max</sub>; however, it is less potent (<em>E</em><sub>50,B</sub>&#x00A0;&#x003E;&#x00A0;<em>E</em><sub>50,A</sub>). Drug C, a partial agonist, can only produce a maximum effect of approximately 50% <em>E</em><sub>max</sub>. If a competitive antagonist is given to a patient, the dose response for the agonist would shift from curve A to curve B&#x2014;although the receptors would have the same affinity for the agonist, the presence of the competitor would necessitate an increase in agonist in order to produce an effect. The agonist would still be able to produce its maximal effect if a sufficient overdose was given to displace the competitive antagonist. However, the competitive antagonist would not change the binding characteristics of the receptor for the agonist and so curve B is simply shifted to the right but remains parallel to curve A. In contrast, if a noncompetitive antagonist binds to the receptor, the agonist<a id="page141"></a> would no longer be able to produce a maximal effect, no matter how much of an overdose is administered (curve C).</p>

<p class="indent">An inverse agonist is a drug that binds to the same receptor as an agonist but induces a pharmacological response opposite to that of the agonists (negative intrinsic activity). A neutral antagonist has no activity in the absence of an agonist or inverse agonist but can block the activity of either. Consequently, the efficacy of a full agonist is 100%, a neutral antagonist has 0% efficacy, and an inverse agonist has &#x003C;0% (ie, negative) efficacy.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Potency is an expression of the activity of the drug, that is, the concentration of the drug required to produce a defined effect. The concentration of the drug that produces 50% of its maximum effect is termed C<sub>50</sub>. The lower the C<sub>50</sub>, the greater the potency of the drug.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong><em>Efficacy</em></strong> is an expression of the therapeutic effectiveness of the drug at its effector site. The efficacy of various drugs of the same class varies depending on their affinity to the receptor.</p>

<p class="dify">Drugs of the same class, acting at the same receptor, differ in their efficacy.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">1. Concentration-Response Relationships</h6>
<p class="nonindent">To estimate the drug effect, we need to know the concentration of the drug at the effect site which, for most anesthetic agents, is usually the brain. Measuring drug concentration in the brain directly is challenging, and hence, drug concentration in plasma is used as a surrogate. For all anesthetic agents, there is a distribution delay for the drug to be transported from the central compartment, that is, plasma, to the site of action. For example, after intravenous injection, propofol needs to be transported to the brain and bind to receptors there in order to cause its effect. After a few minutes, the concentration at the effect site at the neurons in the brain will equilibrate with the plasma propofol<a id="page142"></a> concentration, but this is a noninstantaneous event. Consequently, the effect of sedation or unconsciousness will be produced, depending on the dose of propofol that was administered. This causes a decrease in the bispectral index, which is commonly used to assess the depth of anesthesia. With time, even though the concentration of propofol in the plasma is decreasing, the BIS will continues to remain low as the brain concentration of propofol will still be high. Then propofol will begin to diffuse out of the brain back into plasma because of a reversal in the concentration gradient, and the BIS will start to increase. This mathematically translates into a reverse hysteresis loop, dependent both on the dose and route of administration.<sup><a href="ch007-sec03.xhtml#bib11">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The same drug effect may be seen at two significantly different plasma concentrations, which is termed &#x201C;hysteresis,&#x201D; because the concentration in the brain may significantly lag the concentration in the plasma.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen96">C. Therapeutic Thresholds and Therapeutic Windows</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Therapeutic threshold is the minimum concentration of the drug that produces a desired drug effect. It depends on the required magnitude of the desired effect. For example, melanoma excision is less painful than knee replacement, and hence, the dose of fentanyl required to provide satisfactory analgesia is different for the two procedures. The dose of fentanyl providing analgesia after melanoma excision is not adequate to provide pain relief after knee surgery (ie, below the therapeutic threshold). Conversely, the dose of fentanyl providing pain relief after knee surgery will provide faster pain relief after melanoma excision because it will reach the therapeutic threshold faster. However, this might also result in a fentanyl plasma concentration above the toxic threshold for melanoma excision and result in obvious opioid side effects like respiratory depression. Plainly, the required target plasma concentration of fentanyl is different for the two procedures.</p>

<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The effect site of drug action for anesthetic agents is usually the brain. Clinicians should be aware of the time to peak effect site concentration in order to time noxious procedures such as laryngoscopy.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The range between the therapeutic threshold and the toxic threshold is termed the &#x201C;therapeutic window.&#x201D; The dosage of the drug at which there is a 50% probability of effect is termed the ED<sub>50</sub>, and the dose at which there is a 50% probability of death is the LD<sub>50</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">The therapeutic index (TI) of a drug is the ratio of LD<sub>50</sub> to ED<sub>50</sub>.</p>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/142-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="indent">The higher the TI, the safer the drug.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Propofol has a narrow therapeutic index. Hence, it is important to titrate the timing and dosage of propofol to effect during induction to avoid excessive myocardial depression.</p>
