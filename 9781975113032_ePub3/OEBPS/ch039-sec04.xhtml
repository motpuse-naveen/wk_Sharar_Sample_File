<h5 class="h5" id="sen699">A. X-rays and Fluoroscopy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Fluoroscopy (C-arm) is widely used in many NOR locations, including interventional radiology, cardiac catheterization, electrophysiological procedures, and in the gastroenterology suite. The C-arm moves back and forth around the patient during the procedure, requiring large amounts of space, limiting access to the patient, and serving as a means of dislodging intravenous lines and endotracheal tubes (<strong><a href="ch039-sec02.xhtml#ff39-2">Figure 39.2</a></strong>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen700">B. Computed Tomography</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The CT procedure is painless, and most adults do not require sedation or anesthesia. For children or adults with neurologic or psychological disorders,<a id="page825"></a> sedation or anesthesia may be required. CT scanning may be employed to facilitate invasive and painful procedures such as abscess localization and drainage and ablation of tumors. Patients with acute thoracic, abdominal, and cerebral trauma often require urgent imaging to facilitate diagnosis. These patients may develop hemorrhagic shock, increased intracranial pressure (ICP), depression of consciousness, and cardiac arrest while in the CT scanner.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Hazards of Ionizing Radiation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The effects of <strong><em>ionizing radiation</em></strong> on biologic tissues are classified as deterministic (severity of tissue damage is dose dependent, such as in cataract or infertility) and stochastic (probability of occurrence is dose related, such as in cancer or genetic effect).<sup><a href="ch039-sec05.xhtml#bib6">6</a></sup> Protective measures to reduce patient exposure to radiation should always be taken. Staff exposure to radiation can be minimized by</p>
<ol class="u_num1">
<li><span>Limiting the time of exposure to radiation</span></li>
<li><span>Increasing the distance from the source of radiation</span></li>
<li><span>Using protective shielding (lead aprons, thyroid shields, and leaded eyeglasses)</span></li>
<li><span>Using dosimeters</span></li></ol>

<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The intensity of the radiation is inversely proportional to the <em>square</em> of the distance from the source (the inverse square law).</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen701">C. Magnetic Resonance Imaging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">MRI, like CT, is painless and does not require sedation or anesthesia. However, the scanning sequences are considerably longer than for CT, so a scan of &#x2265;30 minutes for younger children as well as adults with neurologic or psychological disorders, including claustrophobia, often requires sedation or anesthesia.<sup><a href="ch039-sec05.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Thirty percent of adult patients experience some degree of anxiety during MRI scanning.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Hazards of MRI</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>MRI</em></strong> is devoid of the risks related to ionizing radiation. However, magnetizable or ferromagnetic materials and electronic devices represent potential hazards to the patient and staff. For example, cardiac pacemakers may malfunction, intracerebral aneurysm clips may move, and transdermal medication patches may cause burns. Before entering the vicinity of the magnet, patients and staff need to complete a rigorous safety checklist. Ferromagnetic equipment such as intravenous poles, gas cylinders, laryngoscopes, and pens become potentially lethal projectiles if brought too close to the magnetic field. Patient monitors, ventilators, and electrical infusion pumps may malfunction in proximity to the scanner, and magnet-safe technology should be used. In the case of an emergency, resuscitation attempts should take place outside the scanner because equipment such as laryngoscopes and cardiac defibrillators cannot be taken close to the magnet.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">MRI field strength is measured in the units Gauss (G) and Tesla (T). 1&#x00A0;T&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;10,000&#x00A0;G. The Earth&#x2019;s magnetic field is approximately 0.3 to 0.7&#x00A0;G, whereas the standard MRI generates a field of 1.5 to 3&#x00A0;T!</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen702">D. Intravenous Contrast Agents</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Intravenous contrast agents</em></strong> are commonly used in CT and MRI scans to highlight organs, vessels, and tumors. Adverse reactions to contrast agents may occur and can be divided into renal adverse reactions and hypersensitivity reactions.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Renal Adverse Reactions</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Contrast agents are eliminated via the kidneys, and patients with preexisting chronic renal disease, diabetes mellitus, dehydration, advanced age, and<a id="page827"></a> concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are at risk of developing contrast-induced nephropathy. Preventative measures against contrast-induced nephropathy include adequate hydration, maintaining a good urine output, and using sodium bicarbonate infusions to improve elimination of the contrast agent. Gadolinium-containing contrast agents used in MRI scans may cause nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with renal insufficiency.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Hypersensitivity Reactions</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Hypersensitivity reactions</em></strong> to contrast media are divided into immediate (&#x003C;1 hour) and non-immediate (&#x003E;1 hour) reactions. The clinical manifestations of various hypersensitivity reactions to contrast media are outlined in <strong><a href="ch039-sec05.xhtml#tt39-5">Table 39.5</a></strong>. Treatment of moderate and severe immediate hypersensitivity reactions is identical to that of anaphylaxis.</p>
