Having an open upper abdominal surgery has a high rate for developing PPCs. Advocating smoking cessation for greater than 8&#x00A0;weeks, using incentive spirometry (correctly) 10 times an hour, promoting early ambulation, and using multimodal pain control are all crucial in preventing PPCs. Answer B is not the best answer as 4&#x00A0;weeks of smoking cessation is inferior to 8&#x00A0;weeks. Four weeks of smoking cessation may lead to improvement of a patient&#x2019;s mucociliary function, but they still may have increased sputum production leading to PPCs. Answer C is not the best answer as patients who have stopped smoking for 24 hours will have their carbon monoxide levels returned to baseline, but do not gain all the other benefits. Answer D is not the best answer as pain control is essential in preventing PPCs. Use of multimodal analgesia is preferred in order to minimize splinting and improve pulmonary hygiene.</p>"
