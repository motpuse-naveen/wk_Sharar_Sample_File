<p class="nonindent">Glaucoma is a chronic condition of increased IOP, causing gradual loss of sight. There are two types: open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma. In the setting of either type of glaucoma, additional acute increases in IOP during the perioperative period can put the patient&#x2019;s vision at high risk.</p>
<p class="indent">Pupillary constriction moves the iris away from the canal, which lowers the resistance for outflow of aqueous humor. Therefore, muscarinic antagonists or sympathetic alpha-1 agonists, which cause mydriasis, decrease outflow. Conversely, topical cholinergics and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors increase outflow, and so they are indicated as treatment for glaucoma.<sup><a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib15">15</a></sup></p>
