<h4 class="h4" id="sec247">II. Standards of Care for NORA</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Many NOR procedures are performed under <strong><em>sedation</em></strong> or <strong><em>monitored anesthesia care</em></strong>. Anesthesia care may be thought of as a continuum, with a gradual transition from the awake state, through progressively deepening sedation to general anesthesia (<strong><a href="ch039-sec04.xhtml#tt39-4">Table 39.4</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch039-sec05.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">As sedation deepens, progressive blunting of the airway reflexes, with the potential for airway obstruction, together with depression of spontaneous ventilation can ensue. The individual responsiveness of patients to different<a id="page824"></a> sedative agents varies, as do the levels of stimulation during the course of a procedure. Consequently, during the course of an NOR procedure under sedation, the patient may drift to a deeper level than is intended, resulting in airway and respiratory depression. It is, therefore, essential that the person providing sedation be properly trained to care for a patient who drifts to a deeper level of sedation than the level originally intended.</p>

<p class="indent">At the conclusion of the NOR procedure, the patient should be transported by a member of the anesthesia team to a recovery area that is equipped to the same standards as for all postoperative patients.</p>
