<p class="nonindent">Local anesthetics are a class of drugs that transiently and reversibly inhibit the conduction of sensory, motor, and autonomic neural impulses. Clinically, local anesthetics are primarily used to provide perioperative anesthesia or analgesia. This chapter presents the mechanism of action of local anesthetics, the physiochemical properties that determine their clinical pharmacology, clinical applications, and potential for toxicity. Relevant peripheral nerve anatomy and physiology are briefly reviewed here, with more detailed information presented in <a href="ch004.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>. <a href="ch021.xhtml">Chapters 21</a> and <a href="ch031.xhtml">31</a> will present common clinical applications for local anesthetics.</p>
