<h5 class="h5" id="sen595">A. Frailty, Disability, and Comorbidity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Older adults are medically more complex because they suffer from more age-related comorbid conditions (eg, hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease), higher rates of disability (defined as limitations and restrictions of daily activities), and increased incidence of frailty (a state of increased vulnerability that results from decline in reserve and function across multiple physiologic systems). Comorbidity, disability, and frailty are different, yet they often overlap (<strong><a href="#ff34-5">Figure 34.5</a></strong>). Consideration of all three should occur in the assessment of the elderly patient. Disability occurs when patients are unable to perform activities of daily living independently (such as self-feeding, personal hygiene, functional mobility, and dressing). These everyday tasks can be clear markers of a decline in functional status. Frailty or physiologic reserve can account for the patient&#x2019;s ability to recover from a stressor (eg, illness or surgery). When the patient&#x2019;s physiologic limit is reached, the likelihood of functional recovery is low. Frail, older adults may have difficulty recovering from even a medium- or low-risk surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">After puberty, there is little increase in the functional capacity of the major organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys. Generally, the physiologic reserve plateaus during young adulthood and is followed by a gradual decline starting around the age of 40 years. Around the eighth or ninth decade, a more rapid decline occurs. Frailty occurs when the functional reserve declines to the point at which there is limited resistance to stressors (<strong><a href="#ff34-6">Figure 34.6</a></strong>).</p>

Disability is defined as the inability of a person to perform many of the activities of daily life (ADLs). Frailty occurs when there is impairment in physical and physiologic functional reserve. Comorbidity, disability, and frailty do not necessarily overlap.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>

Recovery becomes less likely the more the stress of surgery exceeds a person&#x2019;s physiologic reserve. Most people retain their physiologic reserve through middle age before it gradually starts to decline. Near the end of life, there is a steeper decline as frailty sets in and patients have little tolerance to physiologic stressors.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen596">B. Preoperative Assessment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Many aspects of preoperative assessment are similar in the young and old. However, additional assessments are often required for older adults (<strong><a href="#tt34-2">Table 34.2</a></strong>). For example, older adults are more likely to be using medications that require adjustment in the perioperative period (eg, anticoagulants, antihyperglycemic medications). Informed consent discussions should include broader considerations, such as goals of care, especially in patients undergoing major procedures.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib11">11</a></sup> Older adults are more likely to have advanced care directives; it is important to be aware of the patient&#x2019;s long-term care goals and recognize any durable powers of attorney for health care.</p>
<p class="indent">Comprehensive geriatric assessment is a framework for integrating clinical evaluation and intervention in vulnerable elderly patients. The assessment generally includes an evaluation physical attributes such as functional status, physical frailty, polypharmacy, and cognition; it also includes an assessment of the patient&#x2019;s social and financial support as well as their individual goals of care. Before elective surgery, comprehensive geriatric assessment may be applied to guide targeted interventions that will lead to improved outcomes.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib12">12</a>,<a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib13">13</a></sup></p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The elderly often require more preparation for surgery than young adults due to their polypharmacy and poor functional status; their goals for surgery are often different than for younger patients.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen597"><a id="page737"></a>C. Polypharmacy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Polypharmacy and drug interactions are common in older adults. The risk of adverse drug reactions increases with the number of medications taken. Up to 30% of ambulatory older adults require medical care for adverse drug events, and upwards of 30% of hospitalizations in the elderly are related to drug effects.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib14">14</a></sup> It is important for the anesthesia provider to review the patient&#x2019;s medications (especially central nervous system acting agents, anticoagulants and cardiovascular medications) and be prepared for potential interactions with drugs used in the perioperative period.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen598">D. Malnutrition</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Reduced appetite and impaired thirst mechanism are common in older adults and can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. Malnutrition screening can help identify those who will benefit from oral nutrition and multinutrient supplements. When malnutrition is identified, oral enteral supplementation should be started before (or soon after) major surgery because it may prevent complications.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib15">15</a></sup> Prolonged preoperative fasting should be avoided.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen599">E. Neurocognitive Decline and Depression</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Neurocognitive decline often develops with age and is accompanied by depression. Best practice guidelines recommend that screening for neurocognitive decline and depression (and substance abuse) should be performed in all older adults.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib16">16</a></sup> Simple screening tests for neurocognitive decline, such as the Mini-Cog, are feasible. However, how best to use the information from these screening tools is not obvious. The Beers list (regularly updated by the American Geriatrics Society) is a list of medications that are typically best avoided in older adults. If an older adult is being prescribed one of these medications (<strong><a href="#tt34-3">Table 34.3</a></strong>), it is reasonable to determine whether changes can be made to decrease the dosing or find alternative medications.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Many medications commonly used in anesthesia are relatively contraindicated for use in the elderly. Care should be taken to find alternative medications when possible.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen600">F. Frailty</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Frailty assessment can be used to improve preoperative risk stratification and perioperative planning (<strong><a href="#ff34-7">Figure 34.7</a></strong>). While no single definition of frailty has been agreed upon, there are several conceptual frameworks that are used. The &#x201C;frailty phenotype&#x201D; encompasses the following indicators: unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, muscle weakness, slowness while walking, and low levels of activity. Numerous clinical tools have been developed to identify frailty; some are multidimensional and require equipment and time to administer, while others are short and feasible to implement in a preanesthesia clinic.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib17">17</a></sup> While frailty is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, complications, increased hospital length of stay, and discharge to an institution, different tools are more strongly associated with specific outcomes.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib18">18</a></sup></p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen601">G. Prehabilitation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Once vulnerability is identified preoperatively, it is postulated that a preoperative habilitation program (prehabilitation) designed to increase physical, physiological, metabolic, and psychosocial reserves might be able to improve surgical outcomes.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib19">19</a></sup> Prehabilitation include a bundle of interventions that have been shown to improve outcomes in the nonsurgical population. These include exercise, education (eg, smoking cessation or psychological preparation), and nutritional support. Although small trials in high-risk surgeries show potential benefits, a major challenge to these programs is low adherence to the prehabilitation protocols.</p>
