<h5 class="h5" id="sen177">A. Physiochemical Properties and Relationship to Activity and Potency</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Local anesthetics in solution are weak bases that typically carry a positive charge at the amine group at physiologic pH. The prototypical local anesthetic structure consists of a hydrophobic group (typically a lipid-soluble aromatic ring) connected to a hydrophilic group (charged amine) by either an amide or ester linkage (<strong><a href="#ff12-2">Figure 12.2</a></strong>). The nature of the chemical bond is the basis for classification of local anesthetics as either an aminoamide or aminoester (<strong><a href="#tt12-2">Table 12.2</a></strong>). Although the nature of the linkage determines the basis for metabolism (aminoamides are metabolized in the liver, whereas aminoesters are metabolized by plasma cholinesterase), the physiochemical properties are largely determined by the nature of the alkyl substitutions on either the aromatic ring or the amine group, the charge of the amine group, or the stereochemistry of the related isomers (<strong><a href="#tt12-2">Table 12.2</a></strong>). These physiochemical properties largely determine the potency, onset and duration of action, and tendency for differential nerve block.</p>

<p class="dify">Although the linkage between a local anesthetic&#x2019;s hydrophobic aromatic ring and its hydrophilic amine group determines the molecule&#x2019;s class (aminoamide or aminoester) and metabolic pathway, it is the chemical substitutions on the aromatic ring or amine group that determine the drug&#x2019;s potency, onset, and duration of action.</p>

<p class="indent">The potency and, to a lesser extent, the duration of action of local anesthetics correlates with lipid solubility. Lipid solubility is determined by the degree of alkyl substitutions on either the aromatic ring or the amine group, and it is typically expressed by the partition coefficient in a hydrophobic solvent (typically octanol). Compounds with increased octanol solubility are more lipid soluble (<strong><a href="#tt12-2">Table 12.2</a></strong>). Increased lipid solubility enhances the ability to penetrate the lipid membrane and deliver local anesthetic in closer proximity to the membrane-bound VG<sub>Na</sub>. Although lipid solubility correlates with octanol solubility (and inherent potency in vitro), the minimum in vivo local anesthetic concentration that will block impulse conduction may be affected by numerous factors such as fiber size, type, and myelination; tissue pH (see below); local tissue redistribution and sequestration into lipid-rich perineural compartments; and inherent vasoactive properties of the specific local anesthetic.</p>
<p class="indent">The time to onset of action of local anesthetics correlates with the dissociation constant (p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub>). At physiological pH, local anesthetics are weak bases that exist in equilibrium between either the lipid-soluble base form or the water-soluble ionized form. The relative percentage of each form is determined by the p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub> and surrounding tissue pH. The p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub> is the pH at which the percentage of each form is equal (<strong><a href="#tt12-2">Table 12.2</a></strong>), which is defined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:</p>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/247-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="nonindent">where [BH<sup>+</sup>] is the concentration of the charged, lipid-insoluble form of the local anesthetic, and [B] is the concentration of the uncharged lipid-soluble form of local anesthetic.</p>
<p class="indent">The lower the p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub> for a given local anesthetic, the higher the percentage of the lipid-soluble base form that exists to more readily penetrate the lipid cell membrane, thus speeding the onset of action. After penetration through the cell membrane into the axoplasm, equilibrium between the base form and the charged form is reestablished. It is the charged form within the axoplasm that more avidly binds to local anesthetic binding sites within the channel pore of the VG<sub>Na</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">The duration of action of local anesthetics correlates with protein binding affinity. Freely circulating local anesthetic molecules bind predominantly to &#x03B1;<sub>1</sub>-acid glycoprotein and albumin in plasma. Molecules with high binding affinity have a relatively longer duration of action, which is theorized to be due to a similar increased affinity for binding sites on the VG<sub>Na</sub>. Duration of action is also influenced by rate of vascular absorption of local anesthetic from the injection site. Thus, administration of local anesthetics at a highly vascular site is associated with a higher rate of vascular absorption. Vasoconstrictors decrease the rate of vascular absorption and thus, prolong the duration of action (see the section that follows).</p>

<p class="indent">The majority of clinically useful local anesthetics are formulated as racemic compounds. These are one-to-one mixtures of enantiomeric stereoisomers bearing identical chemical composition, but with a different three-dimensional spatial orientation around an asymmetric carbon atom. Although enantiomers of local anesthetics have identical physiochemical properties, they exhibit different clinical pharmacodynamics (potency) due to subtle differences in interaction and binding of VG<sub>Na</sub>. For example, levobupivacaine (the <em>S</em>-enantiomer of bupivacaine) and ropivacaine (the <em>S</em>-enantiomer of the bupivacaine, but with a propyl alkyl group rather than the butyl group found in bupivacaine) appear to have equipotent clinical efficacy for neuronal conduction block. However, they have a lower potential for cardiac systemic toxicity than either the <em>R</em>-enantiomer or the racemic mixtures.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen178">B. Additives to Augment Local Anesthetic Activity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Local anesthetics are formulated as hydrochloride salts to increase their solubility and stability. The pH of commercially prepared local anesthetic solutions ranges from 3.9 to 6.47 and is especially acidic when prepackaged with epinephrine (see the section that follows). Given that the p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub> of the most commonly used local anesthetics ranges from 7.6 to 8.9 (<strong><a href="#tt12-2">Table 12.2</a></strong>), &#x003C;3% of the local anesthetic solution is in the lipid-soluble neutral form at physiologic pH. This slows penetration through the cell membrane and delays the onset of conduction block. An even lower lipid-soluble fraction may be encountered clinically when local anesthetics are injected into infected tissues that have a more acidic pH. Thus, alkalinization of local anesthetic solutions by the addition of sodium bicarbonate may potentially increase the onset and the quality of conduction block by increasing the percentage of lipid-soluble base form. Clinical experience demonstrates that the addition of sodium bicarbonate may speed the onset of intermediate-acting local anesthetics (lidocaine and mepivacaine). In addition, decreasing the acidity of the local anesthetic solution reduces the burning sensation that occurs with subcutaneous injection. However, this modification has minimal effect with the longer acting, more potent amide local anesthetics (bupivacaine or ropivacaine).<sup><a href="ch012-sec06.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Epinephrine is commonly added to local anesthetic solutions to induce vasoconstriction at the site of injection. The &#x03B1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenoreceptor&#x2013;mediated vasoconstrictive effect of epinephrine augments local anesthetic activity by antagonizing the inherent vasodilating effect of most local anesthetics. Consequently, decreased vascular absorption maintains an increased concentration of anesthetics at the site of action. The reported clinical benefits include enhancement of the quality of conduction block and prolongation of the duration of action. It also decreases the peak systemic local anesthetics levels, potentially limiting toxic effects.<sup><a href="ch012-sec06.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup> The extent to which epinephrine prolongs the duration of conduction block largely depends on the physiochemical properties of the local anesthetic as well as the site of injection. For example, the addition of epinephrine to lidocaine typically extends the conduction block by at least 50%, but the addition of epinephrine to bupivacaine has little or no clinically relevant effect on the duration of blockade. Additional analgesic effects due to epinephrine (and clonidine) may also occur through interaction with &#x03B1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptors in the CNS, directly activating endogenous analgesic mechanisms.</p>
<a id="page250"></a>
<p class="indent">Dexamethasone may be administered to prolong the duration of peripheral nerve blocks by 40% to 70%. The exact mechanism explaining this action is unclear. Motor and sensory block is prolonged after either perineural or intravenous administration, with perineural administration appearing to have slightly increased efficacy compared to systemic administration. Side effects are minimal, although publications of neurotoxicity in animal models exist. Future research should focus identifying the effects (if any) on axonal transmission and neural blood flow (in the presence and absence of local anesthetic).<sup><a href="ch012-sec06.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Clonidine is a direct-acting &#x03B1;<sub>2</sub>-agonist, but it also possesses direct inhibitory effects on neural conduction (A and C peripheral nerve fibers).<sup><a href="ch012-sec06.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup> In contrast to epinephrine, clonidine will improve the duration of conduction block, regardless of whether lidocaine or bupivacaine is used. However, potential clonidine-associated side effects of bradycardia and orthostatic hypotension have limited its more widespread clinical use.</p>
<p class="indent">Dexmedetomidine is another direct-acting &#x03B1;<sub>2</sub>-agonist which, compared to clonidine, is seven times more specific for the &#x03B1;<sub>2</sub> receptor. Perineural administration of 0.5 to 1.0 &#x00B5;g/kg during peripheral nerve blocks can increase block duration by up to 50% and speed the onset of longer acting local anesthetics. Side effects include sedation, bradycardia, and hypotension requiring close postprocedural monitoring.<sup><a href="ch012-sec06.xhtml#bib6">6</a></sup></p>
