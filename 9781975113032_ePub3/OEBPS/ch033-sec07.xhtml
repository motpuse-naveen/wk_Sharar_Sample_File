<h5 class="h5" id="sen574">A. Myelomeningocele</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Spina bifida</em></strong> refers to a range of congenital anomalies of the CNS. The most common is a myelomeningocele, which involves bulging of the spinal cord into a sac filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; <strong><a href="#ff33-4">Figure 33.4</a></strong>). The incidence of myelomeningocele remains at 3.4 per 10,000 live births. Long-term survivors with myelomeningocele have neurologic deficits, including bladder and bowel incontinence as well as sensory and motor deficits related to the level of spinal cord involved in the defect. Surgical interventions can be performed in utero or immediately following birth. Fetal interventions show improved motor outcomes and lower need for CSF shunts.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib42">42</a></sup> Long-term care involves frequent bladder catheterization and potential risk of developing sensitivity to latex products. Latex precautions should be exercised regardless of any history of allergic sensitivity to latex products.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen575">B. Ventriculoperitoneal Shunts</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Children may present with <strong><em>elevated intracranial pressure</em></strong> as a result of various lesions, including anatomic obstruction of CSF flow such as Chiari malformations or tumors. In order to relieve the obstruction of CSF flow, an intraventricular shunt may be placed to redirect flow to a body cavity such as the peritoneal cavity, the pleura, or less commonly an intravascular location such as the right atrium. Patients with existing shunts may present with shunt malfunction or infection and may require emergency surgery to alleviate the shunt malfunction. Preanesthetic evaluation should focus on assessing signs of <strong><em>increased intracranial pressure</em></strong>, such as depressed consciousness, nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, and hypertension. Induction of anesthesia should weigh the potential risk of aspiration with the risk of brain herniation in the setting of elevated intracranial pressure. Surgical approach typically requires access to the head, neck, thorax, and abdomen. Infants and children are particularly prone to hypothermia due to exposure to surgical preparation solution as well as an inability to provide adequate heat source during the procedure. Patient positioning may also result in endobronchial intubation, particularly in small children. Although the risk of hemorrhage is small, it is significant particularly in young children as well as shunt revisions that may involve a vascular component. Patients should be considered for an awake examination after surgery unless the patient&#x2019;s baseline condition is not suitable for extubation and emergence.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen576">C. Craniofacial Surgery</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Craniofacial reconstruction</em></strong> is performed for children with premature fusion of cranial sutures during development. Surgical correction is performed to <a id="page717"></a>improve appearance as well as to reduce the risk of increased pressure on areas of the developing brain and potential long-term effects on development resulting from inhibited brain growth. Depending on the type and severity of the deformity, it may be corrected in one or more stages typically during the first years of life. Each surgical procedure is associated with variable scalp dissection and cranial osteotomies. Children should be evaluated for associated syndromes (ie, <strong><em>Crouzon</em></strong> and <strong><em>Saethre-Chotzen</em></strong>), which can be associated with difficult airway as well as difficult intravascular access. Intraoperative management typically includes continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring. To detect <strong><em>air embolism</em></strong>, use of a Doppler monitor is suggested. Central venous access should be considered to assist management in complex procedures, particularly if peripheral vascular access is not adequate (at least two large bore intravenous lines). Despite surgical efforts to minimize hemorrhage, patients typically require transfusion of approximately one circulating blood volume.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib43">43</a></sup> Preemptive administration of fresh frozen plasma during surgery has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of postoperative coagulopathy. Surgical complications may include tearing of dural sinuses as well as tearing of the dura during osteotomies.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen577">D. Tonsillectomy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Children presenting for tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy comprise a large amount of all pediatric anesthesiology practices. The indications for the procedures range from recurrent tonsillitis to <strong><em>obstructive sleep apnea</em></strong> with various levels of symptomatology.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib44">44</a></sup> Children with Down syndrome, craniofacial anomalies, neuromuscular disorders, sickle cell disease, or mucopolysaccharidoses are at increased risk for postoperative complications from adenotonsillectomy, particularly in terms of postoperative airway obstruction. Airway obstruction can increase the duration of inhalation induction as well as emergence of anesthesia. Furthermore, children with chronic sleep apnea may have increased sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Airway management is typically performed with an oral Ring-Adair-Elwyn (RAE) endotracheal tube that allows surgical access to the airway for the procedure. During emergence, anesthesiologists should take care to avoid contact with the tonsillar beds by oral airways or suctioning equipment to minimize the risk of hemorrhage. Postsurgical hemorrhage is associated with morbidity and mortality, particularly if there is active hemorrhage during airway management phases such as induction or emergence of anesthesia. Postoperative care ranges from ambulatory surgical care to monitoring in an intensive care unit and is based on the individual comorbidities as well as the postoperative course exhibited by an individual patient. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is a significant risk and should be treated prophylactically with dexamethasone and ondansetron unless otherwise contraindicated (ie, dexamethasone is contraindicated for patients with leukemia due to possibility of tumor lysis syndrome and interference with chemotherapy protocols). Children scheduled for ambulatory tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy should be carefully observed for adequate analgesia and any signs of airway obstruction prior to discharge from the facility.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen578">E. Cleft Lip and Palate</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Cleft lip and palate make up the <strong><em>most common congenital deformity</em></strong> of the head and neck, affecting between 0.5 and 1 child per 1000 births with variation across ethnic groups worldwide (<strong><a href="#ff33-5">Figure 33.5</a></strong>). Maternal exposure to phenytoin has been shown to increase the risk of cleft lip, and tobacco use nearly doubles the risk of cleft lip. Various syndromes and genetic disorders may be associated with cleft lip or palate as well and may be a predisposing factor for perioperative airway complications.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib45">45</a></sup> The anesthetic management plan should recognize these comorbidities. Surgical correction varies based on the type of defect as well as the age of the child and may be performed in one or more stages. Anesthetic management may be highlighted by difficulty with laryngoscopy if either the laryngoscope blade or endotracheal tube is caught in the cleft. Furthermore, positioning of the child during surgery may result in dislodgement of the endotracheal tube or endobronchial intubation. Typically, an oral RAE endotracheal tube is preferred to facilitate surgical access to the airway. Children undergoing repair may be as young as 10&#x00A0;weeks, thus choosing an appropriately sized endotracheal tube is critical. Cuffed oral RAE tubes may not be universally available. As a result, uncuffed endotracheal tubes may result in a large leak or inappropriate depth. When uncuffed tubes are used, large leaks may be managed by inserting a throat pack. Following the repair, children are prone to airway obstruction upon extubation. It is critical that nasopharyngeal airways are avoided unless they are placed by the surgeon at the time of the repair. Postoperative care should focus on maintaining adequate respiration while managing analgesia and hydration.</p>

B, Bilateral cleft palate (laryngoscopic view).</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen579">F. Diaphragmatic Hernia</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Diaphragmatic hernias occur as a result of a defect in the diaphragm that results in <strong><em>herniation of abdominal contents</em></strong> into the thoracic cavity (<strong><a href="#ff33-6">Figure 33.6</a></strong>). There are anatomic variants, including Bochdalek (70%-90%), Morgagni (20%-30%), and central (1%-2%) diaphragmatic hernias.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib46">46</a>,<a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib47">47</a></sup> This condition usually begins to develop in early gestation during the first trimester. As a result, the affected lung is compressed and not able to develop due to the presence of abdominal organs in the hemithorax. The diagnosis can be made by prenatal diagnostic tests such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging.</p>
<p class="indent">Because one lung will be underdeveloped, the patient will have elevated pulmonary vascular resistance as well as limited capacity for gas exchange, which can be life-threatening. The prevalence ranges from 1 in 2500 to 4000 and has a 30% to 60% mortality rate. Even after surgical correction, children may develop chronic lung disease as well as pulmonary hypertension. Furthermore, the herniated organs can become distended (ie, stomach distention during mask ventilation or crying), which could result in further impairment of lung mechanics for both lungs. Depending on the severity of the condition, the child may not be able to sustain oxygenation and circulation without assistance. In some cases, the patient may be placed on <strong><em>extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)</em></strong> as a bridge prior to surgical repair.</p>
<a id="page719"></a>
<div class="figureu5" id="ff33-6"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff33-6.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="ucaption"><span class="u_fignum">Figure&#160;33.6</span> <strong>Diaphragmatic hernia showing intestine (I) in left thorax. Note position of stomach bubble (S) and shift of heart (H) into right thorax.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Considerations for anesthetic management depend on the severity of the case and whether the child can be safely transported from the NICU to the operating room. In some cases, the procedure may be done at the NICU bedside with ECMO. If a patient is not intubated or on ECMO, the anesthesiologist must take care to avoid airway obstruction and ensure ventilation takes place without excessive pressure to avoid overdistention of the stomach and intestines. Distended organs may lead to increased difficulty with ventilation as well as increased difficulty of the surgical procedure. Adequate intravenous access should be ensured with at least two peripheral intravenous lines. The surgical approach may be by laparotomy or thoracotomy. Laparotomy precludes the use of umbilical lines for vascular access. Continuous arterial monitoring is warranted to allow for blood gas monitoring for oxygenation and ventilation as well as for monitoring hemoglobin during the procedure.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen580">G. Anterior Mediastinal Mass</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Anterior mediastinal masses range from benign to malignant but may become life threatening due to <strong><em>compression of vital structures</em></strong> such as the trachea, great vessels, or the heart.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib48">48</a></sup> The etiology includes lymphoma, thymoma, germ cell tumors, metastatic lesions, bronchogenic masses, or thyroid masses. Preoperative assessment is critical to determine the extent of symptomatology, particularly if there is dyspnea, stridor, or syncope and any postural <a id="page720"></a>component. History and examination should focus on identifying any position that exacerbates the symptom to assist in perioperative care. Diagnostic imaging may include plain radiographs, computed tomography scan, and echocardiogram to characterize the mass as well as signs of cardiovascular compromise. Initial management typically involves obtaining a tissue sample to establish a diagnosis prior to initiating treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation to reduce the size of the mass. Induction of general anesthesia may be catastrophic if the mass shifts in position and compresses the airway or cardiovascular structures in the chest, resulting in an inability to ventilate and marked reduction in cardiac output. In high-risk scenarios, the priorities should always be to maintain spontaneous ventilation and to avoid neuromuscular blockade and positive pressure ventilation. In the event that cardiovascular collapse or difficulty with ventilation is encountered, the patient should be placed in a rescue position, which consists of the positions that improved the symptoms based on preoperative history. This may involve the upright sitting, lateral decubitus, or prone position. Furthermore, cardiopulmonary bypass may be required for a patient with a critical mediastinal mass.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen581">H. Tracheoesophageal Fistula or Esophageal Atresia</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Tracheoesophageal fistula results when an abnormal connection from the esophagus to the trachea is present due to failed fusion of tracheoesophageal ridges in early embryonal development.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> This can occur in 1 of 3500 live births and is usually a postnatal diagnosis. Children may present with inability to eat or recurrent aspiration with oxygen requirement. In most cases, a nasogastric or orogastric tube is advanced and is unable to pass to the stomach. The specific diagnosis is usually confirmed by bronchoscopy prior to surgical repair. There are five types of tracheoesophageal fistula (<strong><a href="#ff33-7">Figure 33.7</a></strong>). The most common is a proximal blind esophageal pouch and a distal esophageal segment that communicates with the trachea (approximately 90% of cases), with the other types being less common.</p>
<p class="indent">There can be associated conditions, most notably the VATER or VACTERL syndromes (<em>V</em>ertebral anomalies, <em>A</em>nal atresia, <em>C</em>ardiac defects, <em>T</em>racheoesophageal fistula and/or <em>E</em>sophageal atresia, <em>R</em>enal and radial anomalies, and <em>L</em>imb defects). Although surgical correction is paramount to allow the child to eat and grow, a complete workup including echocardiogram should be performed to rule out any associated cardiac anomalies.</p>
<div class="figureu5" id="ff33-7"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff33-7.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="ucaption"><span class="u_fignum">Figure&#160;33.7</span> <strong>Relative frequencies of anatomic variations of esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal atresia.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page721"></a>Prior to surgical correction, a Replogle tube is typically placed in the esophagus to empty any secretions. The child is not fed, and efforts should be made to soothe the child, as crying may lead to stomach distention, resulting in abdominal compression and respiratory distress. The initial approach typically requires flexible or rigid bronchoscopy to establish the anatomic location of the defect. The surgical approach will be dictated by the location of the defect, ranging from a thoracotomy or laparotomy, and may be completed over multiple stages. Induction of general anesthesia should focus on limiting stomach distention as well as adequate positioning of the endotracheal tube in relation to the fistula. In some cases, the fistula can be large enough to fit the endotracheal tube, and changing the patient&#x2019;s position throughout the procedure may result in &#x201C;intubation&#x201D; of the fistula.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen582">I. Pyloric Stenosis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pyloric stenosis is one of the most common conditions requiring surgical intervention in infants, with an incidence of 2 to 9 per 1000 live births.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> Infants typically present with an inability to tolerate oral feeding and classic projectile vomiting in the first 3&#x00A0;months of life, resulting in <strong><em>hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis</em></strong>. If untreated, the condition can be fatal. Initial management consists of adequate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to restore normal circulating blood volume and electrolyte anomalies. The diagnosis may be confirmed with palpation of the thickened pylorus or by ultrasound studies. Anesthetic management should focus on minimizing aspiration of gastric contents.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Suctioning the infant&#x2019;s stomach immediately prior to the induction of anesthesia until little or no gastric fluid is retrieved has been successfully applied to reduce the risk of gastric content reflux during induction of anesthesia.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen583">J. Necrotizing Enterocolitis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains a devastating problem affecting preterm infants during the first weeks to months of life.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> Despite advances in perinatal and neonatal care, the incidence of NEC has not decreased, and its <strong><em>morbidity and mortality remain high</em></strong>. Infants may present with abdominal distention resulting in hemodynamic instability and respiratory failure. Breast milk has been found to offer protection against developing NEC, despite advances in neonatal formula mixtures over the years. Though management strategies have evolved, the common therapies include cessation of gastric feeding, mechanical ventilation, and antibiotic therapy. Infants requiring surgical management are at the highest risk for morbidity and mortality and may not be stable enough to be transported out of the NICU. In such extreme cases, the surgical procedure may be performed at the NICU bedside. Surgical procedures may be complicated by hemorrhage as well as large fluid shifts. Infants may require transfusions in excess of 100&#x00A0;mL/kg and are at risk of transfusion-related complications such as coagulopathy and hyperkalemia.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen584">K. Omphalocele and Gastroschisis</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Omphalocele</em></strong> and <strong><em>gastroschisis</em></strong> are rare abdominal wall defects affecting 2 in 10,000 live births and 3 in 10,000 live births, respectively.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> Gastroschisis is not associated with an overlying sac and results in exposed intra-abdominal organs. Gastroschisis is not usually associated with other congenital defects. Omphalocele is characterized by herniation of abdominal contents through a defect, although they are protected from the environment by a membrane. Omphalocele is associated with other anomalies including pentalogy of Cantrell, bladder or cloacal exstrophy, trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), or Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> Both gastroschisis and omphaloceles require surgical management, which typically involves gradual reduction of <a id="page722"></a>the externalized abdominal contents via a mesh or silo. The process can be performed through various procedures to allow for gradual expansion of the abdominal cavity. It can be complicated by abdominal competition and difficulty with ventilation due to increased intrathoracic pressures from a bulging diaphragm.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen585">L. Scoliosis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Children may present for surgical correction of <strong><em>scoliosis</em></strong> that results from neuromuscular defects with misalignment of the vertebral column or simply as &#x201C;idiopathic&#x201D; scoliosis.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup> In severe cases, gross deformities of the chest and abdomen may result in thoracic insufficiency and impair lung development. Furthermore, some patients may suffer neurologic sequelae such as nerve compression, which manifests as weakness, and sensory defects depending on the affected area. Surgical correction of scoliosis in a growing child remains controversial and treatment alternatives vary by surgeon, patient age, and coexisting disease. Surgical options include posterior spine fusion and vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib. Anesthetic management should be tailored to meet the monitoring needs, as neurophysiologic monitoring may be used to assist and provide safety in the surgical approach. Agents that may affect the quality of motor and somatosensory-evoked potentials should be avoided, including volatile anesthetics, nitrous oxide, and neuromuscular blockade. Total intravenous anesthesia with propofol infusion and opioid infusions such as fentanyl or remifentanil are commonly used. The surgical procedures may be associated with significant hemodynamic derangements, including massive hemorrhage, spinal shock, coagulopathy, and hypothermia. Furthermore, positioning the patient should be done carefully to avoid pressure on the eyes, shoulders, and genitals to minimize position-related complications. Postoperative visual loss is uncommon but devastating and may occur as a result of ischemic optic neuropathy associated with the long duration of surgery. Intraoperative management should place specific emphasis on adequate intravascular access, with consideration for continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring as well as central venous access on a case-by-case basis. Blood conservation strategies such as antifibrinolytic agents, blood salvage techniques, and autologous blood donation may be used based on the resources available. Postoperative pain management may require support from a dedicated team.</p>
