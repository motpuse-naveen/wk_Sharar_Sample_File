<h4 class="h4" id="sec42">V. Assessment of Hepatic Function</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Due to the multiple &#x201C;functions&#x201D; of the liver and its sizable metabolic capacity, there is no single liver function test that is specific or accurate in identifying impaired hepatic function. Rather, assessment of hepatic function is more typically a triangulation process that incorporates clinical findings (history, physical examination), hepatobiliary imaging studies (ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, contrast radiography), and various laboratory tests.<sup><a href="ch006-sec06.xhtml#bib2">2</a>,<a href="ch006-sec06.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup> Laboratory tests are categorized as static and dynamic (<strong><a href="#ff6-9">Figure 6.9</a></strong>). <strong><em>Static tests</em></strong> generally measure blood levels of individual hepatic enzymes (typically elevated when liver injury is present) and are widely available. <strong><em>Dynamic tests</em></strong> measure functional pathways of hepatic synthesis products (typically reduced when liver injury is present), substrate clearance and elimination or metabolite formation, but they are infrequently available and expensive. Routine laboratory testing of liver function is not advised because commonly used static liver function tests do not accurately reflect organ function, but instead indicate varying degrees of liver inflammation or damage. Instead, testing should be performed if the medical history, current disease process, or physical examination arouses suspicion of acute or chronic hepatic disease or if surgery involving the liver is planned.</p>

<p class="dify">Much like the combination of cardiac imaging and cardiac enzyme measurements used to assess heart function and cardiac injury, the combination of hepatic imaging (computed tomography, ultrasound) and hepatic enzyme measurements (transaminases) is used to assess liver function and hepatic injury.</p>

<p class="indent">Standard laboratory assays can potentially indicate organ injury (transaminases, bilirubin), impaired synthetic function (serum albumin, prothrombin time, fibrinogen), or systemic effects of advanced organ dysfunction (platelet count). Specific static laboratory tests include the hepatic transaminases aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (AP), and &#x03B3;-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). The AST enzyme is also found in muscle and other nonhepatic tissues, and AP is also found in<a id="page125"></a> bone, placenta, and intestine. In contrast, ALT and GGT are almost exclusively found in the liver; therefore, ALT and GGT are felt to be more specific indicators of liver pathology. Both AST and ALT can be elevated in settings of acute liver damage when the enzymes leak out of injured hepatocytes into the blood. In chronic liver disease, elevations in AST and ALT may not be present; however, the AST/ALT ratio is typically elevated in patients with alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. An AST/ALT ratio &#x003E;2 is present in &#x223C;70% of these patients compared with 26% of patients with postnecrotic cirrhosis, 8% with chronic hepatitis, 4% with viral hepatitis, and none with obstructive jaundice. If AP or GGT levels are elevated, a problem with bile flow is most likely present. Bile flow problems can be due to a bile duct pathology within the liver, the gallbladder, or the extrahepatic ducts.</p>

<p class="indent">As noted previously, unconjugated bilirubin is a breakdown product of heme from erythrocytes and is then conjugated with glucuronic acid in the liver for excretion in the bile. Elevated blood levels of &#x201C;indirect bilirubin&#x201D; (unconjugated bilirubin) indicate excessive hemoglobin breakdown (eg, hemolysis) or impaired hepatic conjugation function. Elevated blood levels of &#x201C;direct bilirubin&#x201D; (conjugated bilirubin) occur when hepatic function is normal but bilirubin excretion is impaired (eg, common bile duct obstruction). Bilirubin elevation is associated with abnormal physical examination findings of scleral icterus and cutaneous jaundice.</p>

<p class="indent"><strong><em>Albumin</em></strong> is a major protein formed by the liver; thus, chronic liver disease can impair albumin production and result in reduced blood albumin levels. Hypoalbuminemia has significant systemic effects on both protein binding of drugs (eg, hypoalbuminemia results in larger fractions of unbound drug [see <a href="ch007.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>]) and oncotic pressure (eg, hypoalbuminemia results in lower plasma oncotic pressure, favoring water movement to extravascular tissues in the form of edema and ascites [see <a href="ch003.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>]).</p>
<p class="indent">Because many protein coagulation factors are synthesized in the liver, liver injury can result in abnormal blood clotting or reductions in circulating coagulation factors. Indirect assessment of liver function by coagulation testing is most commonly done by measuring the prothrombin time and calculating its associated international normalized ratio (INR). Blood fibrinogen is the most frequently tested individual coagulation factor.</p>
