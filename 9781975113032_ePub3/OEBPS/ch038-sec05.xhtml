<h5 class="h5" id="sen695">A. Management of Common Pain Syndromes</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Low-back and buttock pain can have a number of possible etiologies, including disk herniation or internal disruption, facet joint syndrome, piriformis syndrome, sacroiliac joint syndrome, myofascial pain, fibromyalgia, as well as vertebral body compression fractures, inflammatory conditions, spinal neoplastic lesions, infections, and rarely vascular malformations.<sup><a href="#bib4">4</a></sup></p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Low-Back Pain: Radicular Pain Syndromes</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">When pain radiates in a dermatomal distribution, it is considered <strong><em>radicular</em></strong> and can be accompanied by weakness, depressed reflexes, numbness, and tingling in the same dermatomal distribution (<strong><a href="#ff38-5">Figure 38.5</a></strong>; <strong><a href="#tt38-4">Table 38.4</a></strong>). Pain is typically sharp and lancinating. Physical examination often reveals antalgic gait, limited straight leg raise test, diminished or absent reflexes, reduced strength, and decreased sensation in the affected spinal level. Radicular pain is typically the result of irritation or dysfunction of the spinal nerve root in the epidural space, which can be due to mechanical compression of the nerve root and/or a chemical radiculitis from the inflammatogenic cascade of leukotrienes and cytokines released by the injured disk. Spinal imaging can be helpful in diagnosis and should be obtained early in setting of neurological change, history of IV drug use, suspected infection, history of significant trauma, history of cancer, and in the immunosuppressed host.</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment of radicular pain syndromes is best managed in a multimodal fashion. NSAID medications, oral steroids, physical therapy (PT), short periods of bed rest, and neuropathic pain medications such as gabapentin or pregabalin can be helpful. If symptoms do not respond to these measures, <strong><em>epidural steroid injection (ESI)</em></strong> of corticosteroid can reduce inflammation in the epidural space by reducing the activity of phospholipase A2 and blocking nociceptive C-fiber conduction. ESIs have been shown to provide short-term (&#x003C;3&#x00A0;months) relief of radicular pain. ESIs are most effective in patients with acute radiculitis and less effective for management of chronic symptoms and nonradicular pain. Surgery does not appear to produce better long-term outcomes for radiculitis than a more conservative approach. The natural history of low-back and radicular pain due to a herniated disk is one of gradual improvement with conservative measures. Thus, the use of epidural steroids can minimize the use of systemic medications and their attendant side effects during periods of exacerbation.</p>

<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">ESIs are most effective in patients with acute radiculitis and less effective for management of chronic symptoms and nonradicular pain. Surgery does not appear to produce better long-term outcomes for radiculitis than a more conservative approach.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page810"></a>ESIs are best performed with fluoroscopy guidance. In the interlaminar approach, a Tuohy epidural needle is advanced through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, and finally the ligamentum flavum. A loss of resistance technique to air, or saline, is employed to confirm entry into the dorsal epidural space after traversing the ligamentum flavum. Alternatively, the transforaminal approach may be used, which deposits the steroid more ventrally, closer to the disk-nerve interface. In this technique, the entry point is off midline to the affected side and the needle is directed through skin and paraspinal musculature, traveling medially toward the intervertebral foramen. In both techniques, a small amount of radiopaque contrast is injected to confirm epidural placement, and rule out vascular or intrathecal uptake. Following confirmation of epidural placement, corticosteroid diluted in local anesthetic or saline is injected (<strong><a href="#ff38-6">Figure 38.6</a></strong>).</p>
<div class="figureu5" id="ff38-6"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff38-6.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="ucaption"><span class="u_fignum">Figure&#160;38.6</span> <strong>Lateral view of an interlaminar approach showing predominant spread of the contrast in the posterior epidural space with minimal spread into the anterior epidural space. ESI, epidural steroid injection.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page811"></a>There are multiple randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of ESI with varying results.<sup><a href="#bib5">5</a></sup> Most show short-term relief of lumbar radiculopathy symptoms. There are fewer studies of ESIs in cervical radiculopathy, but those also generally show short-term relief of symptoms.<sup><a href="#bib6">6</a></sup> There have been comparisons between the transforaminal and interlaminar approaches, which generally favor the transforaminal technique. Comparison of transforaminal to lateral interlaminar (parasagittal) showed better contrast spread in parasagittal injections but with similar efficacy. The short-term relief achieved from ESI can be helpful in returning a patient to function and reducing the toxicity from systemic medications, but it should be used as an adjuvant to multimodal therapy, not a sole treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">Complications include damage to the spinal cord or peripheral spinal nerves, epidural hematoma and infection, all of which can cause irreversible neurologic deficit. The incidence of hematoma is reduced by the timely discontinuation of anticoagulant agents per the American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA) guidelines for neuraxial intervention.<sup><a href="#bib7">7</a></sup> Penetration of the radicular artery during lumbar transforaminal ESI, or the ascending cervical, deep cervical, or vertebral artery during cervical transforaminal ESI, can result in traumatic shearing, vasospasm, or embolism of steroid, which, in turn, can cause infarction to the brain or spinal cord.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, systemic corticosteroid absorption can cause side effects. Blood pressure and serum glucose levels can be elevated anywhere from 2&#x00A0;days to several weeks after ESI. Exogenous corticosteroids can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with even a single dose reducing plasma cortisol and corticotropin levels for weeks.</p>
<p class="indent">The patient should be reevaluated 2 to 3&#x00A0;weeks after the ESI. If there is no response to a single injection, it can be repeated once, because some patients who did not have relief after one injection have relief after the second. A third injection can be performed if partial relief occurs, but a series of more than three regardless of relief is not advised.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Low-Back Pain: Facet Syndrome</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The zygapophyseal joints (facet joints) are paired diarthrodial joints formed by the articulation of the inferior articular process of one vertebra with the superior articular process of the inferior vertebra. Along with the disk, the paired facet joints form the three-joint complex responsible for load bearing and prevent forward displacement and rotatory dislocation of the intervertebral joint. They normally transmit 10% to 15% of the body&#x2019;s weight and are subject to arthritis and increased forces in the presence of spondylolisthesis and disk degeneration. Facetogenic pain is axial and can radiate to the buttock and posterior thigh on the affected side. Physical examination is positive for paraspinal muscle tenderness and pain with ipsilateral rotation during extension. Facet joints are innervated by the medial branches of the dorsal rami, so pain relief from medial branch blocks or facet joint injections can confirm diagnosis. Intra-articular facet joint injections of corticosteroid can produce long-lasting analgesia. If pain relief is transient and there is relief from medial branch blocks, radiofrequency ablation of the medial branches can be performed.<sup><a href="#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<h6 class="h6">Buttock Pain: Sacroiliac Joint Syndrome</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Sacroiliac (SI) joints are paired joints formed by the articulation of the sacrum to the ileum, they are vital load bearing joints with little mobility. Like any <a id="page812"></a>joint, the SI joint is subject to arthritis, either intrinsic or secondary to spondyloarthropathies, and vulnerable to any biomechanical abnormalities affecting the lower extremity-pelvis-spine interface. SI joint pain is commonly described near the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) and the buttock. It may radiate to the posterior thigh and calf as well as the groin. Physical examination is significant for pain with palpation of the PSIS and stressing of the joint, such as by the FABER (Flexion, Abduction and External Rotation of the hip). Gaenslen, or Yeoman maneuvers. Treatment of SI joint syndrome can include physical therapy, NSAIDs, intra-articular steroid injections, radiofrequency denervation of the L5 medial branch and sacral (S1-S3) lateral branches, and surgical fusion.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Buttock Pain: Piriformis Syndrome</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Buttock pain originating from the piriformis occurs from muscular irritation, such as from trauma, infection, or surgery. Pain may radiate to the posterior thigh and calf, indicating irritation of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle. The pain is typically worse with prolonged sitting or moving from sitting to standing. Physical examination reveals pain with <em>f</em>lexion, <em>a</em>dduction, and <em>i</em>nternal <em>r</em>otation (FAIR, Lasegue) of the hip, with the patient supine; pain or weakness with resisted abduction with hip flexed (pace), with the patient sitting; and pain with passive internal rotation of an extended thigh (Freiberg sign). Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging may show enlarged piriformis; electromyogram may show signs of neuropathy or myopathy, but the diagnosis is clinical. Treatment includes physical therapy, NSAIDs, and muscle relaxants. Injections of local anesthetic and steroid into the muscle belly can also be helpful. Intramuscular botulinum toxin, or surgical release, can be considered in refractory cases.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Myofascial Pain Syndrome</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Trigger points are focal, palpable areas of pain in muscle or fascia. Palpation of these nodules may provoke a twitch response or reproduce radiating pain in a distribution characteristic of the muscle involved. <strong><em>Myofascial pain syndrome</em></strong> is local, regional, and referred pain that originates from these trigger points. Treatment of myofascial pain syndrome includes massage and stretching, postural training, physical therapy, trigger point injections with local anesthetic or botulinum toxin, and dry needling.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Fibromyalgia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Fibromyalgia is associated with widespread pain, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and cognitive/psychosomatic perturbations. Diagnostic criteria no longer depend upon presence of tender points on physical examination, but place greater emphasis on patient-reported symptoms. Per 2016 revision, the diagnosis of fibromyalgia can be made if all of the following criteria are fulfilled: (1) generalized pain in at least four of five regions (left upper, left lower, right upper, right lower, and axial [jaw, chest, and abdominal pain are not included]), (2) presence of symptoms for at least 3&#x00A0;months, (3) widespread pain index (WPI)&#x00A0;&#x2265;&#x00A0;7 and symptom severity scale (SSS) score&#x00A0;&#x2265;&#x00A0;5 OR WPI of 4 to 6 and SSS score&#x00A0;&#x2265;&#x00A0;9, and (4) diagnosis of fibromyalgia is valid regardless of other diagnoses.<sup><a href="#bib9">9</a></sup> Other regional pain syndromes (headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, interstitial cystitis) may also be present. Treatment of fibromyalgia is multimodal and should include an exercise program, cognitive behavioral therapy, land- and/or aquatic-based PT, and medications. Opiates are typically not effective, but SNRIs (eg, <a id="page813"></a>milnacipran, duloxetine, venlafaxine), pregabalin, gabapentin, and TCAs can be helpful.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Neuropathic Pain Syndromes</h6>
<p class="h7"><strong><em>Herpes Zoster (HZ) and PHN</em></strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">PHN is a chronic neuropathic pain following reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection within neuronal cells. HZ classically manifests as pain and a vesicular eruption within a dermatomal fashion, and most cases will resolve with medication therapy, but 5% to 20% go on to develop PHN. PHN is characterized by chronic allodynia, hyperalgesia, and dysesthesias within the same dermatome as prior HZ rash, and is attributed to immune versus inflammatory damage to neurons during VZV reactivation. Rates of PHN rise steeply after the age of 65 years, such that 20% to 30% of elderly patients with HZ develop PHN. Besides older age, other risk factors include high intensity of pain during acute zoster, severity of zoster rash, and painful prodrome (presence of pain prior to rash onset). In adults VZV reactivation can be prevented by vaccination with the live attenuated shingles vaccine approved for adults &#x003E;50&#x00A0;years of age. In adults who develop HZ, the likelihood of developing PHN is reduced by prompt administration of antiviral drugs such as acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir.<sup><a href="#bib10">10</a></sup></p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The likelihood of developing PHN is reduced by prompt administration of antiviral drugs.</p>
<p class="dify">Treatment of PHN is primarily medical, relying on the use of anticonvulsants such as gabapentin and pregabalin, TCAs, and topical lidocaine as first-line treatments.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Opioid analgesics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and topical capsaicin can be utilized in conjunction with first-line agents or solely as second-line treatments for refractory disease. Topical medications such as lidocaine patch and capsaicin can also be helpful. The following intervention can be tried if medications are ineffective: subcutaneous injection of botulinum toxin A or triamcinolone, peripheral nerve stimulation, stellate ganglion blockade, paravertebral blocks, and pulsed radiofrequency ablation. If severe pain persists, spinal cord stimulation can be considered. Destruction of the dorsal root ganglion and intrathecal methylprednisolone injection should only be entertained after careful discussion with the patient.</p>
<p class="h7"><strong><em>Diabetic Painful Neuropathy</em></strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The incidence of DPN increases with age, duration of diabetes, and severity of hyperglycemia. The most common subtypes are distal symmetric polyneuropathy, proximal neuropathy, focal neuropathy, and visceral autonomic neuropathy. It is unknown why some patients experience painful neuropathy and others do not.</p>
<p class="indent">Treatments include tight glycemic control and neuropathic medications. The serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (eg, duloxetine, milnacipran) are considered first-line therapy due to their efficacy and favorable side effect profile. Other medications include gabapentin, pregabalin, TCAs, and anticonvulsants. Opioids are considered last-line medications. Spinal cord stimulation has been effective at managing neuropathic symptoms up to 5&#x00A0;years post initiation of treatment.<sup><a href="#bib11">11</a>,<a href="#bib12">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="h7"><strong><em>Complex Regional Pain Syndrome</em></strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain syndrome that can develop after a known nerve injury (type II, formerly causalgia) or in the absence of previous nerve injury (type I, formerly reflex sympathetic dystrophy). It is characterized by sensory, sudomotor, vasomotor, and motor/trophic signs and symptoms.<sup><a href="#bib13">13</a></sup> Sensory changes include allodynia, hyperalgesia, hyperesthesia, or spontaneous pain. Sudomotor changes are sweating abnormalities or edema. Vasomotor symptoms are temperature abnormalities or skin color changes. Motor deficiencies include decreased range of motion, weakness, tremor, or neglect. Trophic changes are changes in hair or nail growth (<strong><a href="#tt38-5">Table 38.5</a></strong>). Risk factors include female sex, work-related injury, and previous surgery. The diagnosis is one of exclusion, is made clinically utilizing the Budapest criteria, and can be supported by osteopenia on radiographs and metabolic alterations on three-phase bone scan.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Treatment should be multimodal and focus on functional restoration, pain management, and psychological treatment. Physical therapy is useful for desensitization and strengthening. Medications can include gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, TCAs, memantine, opioids, calcitonin, and bisphosphonates. Sympathetic blocks of the upper (stellate) and lower (lumbar paravertebral sympathetic) extremity ganglions with local anesthetic can be effective in the acute phase to reduce allodynia and permit functional restoration. In refractory cases of CRPS spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and/or dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation of the lower extremity can be effective procedural approaches to analgesia.</p>
<p class="h7"><strong><em>HIV Neuropathy</em></strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Neuropathy in HIV can be viral related or due to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors used for treatment of the infection. Allodynia and hyperalgesia are most commonly located in the lower extremities and may respond to lamotrigine or gabapentin (<strong><a href="#tt38-6">Table 38.6</a></strong>).</p>

</div>
<p class="h7"><a id="page815"></a><strong><em>Phantom Pain</em></strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Phantom limb sensation may be experienced by up to 80% of patients with amputated extremities, but phantom pain is significantly less common. The incidence may be reduced by adequate preoperative pain control prior to the amputation. Methods have included epidural infusion and continuous plexus blocks. Treatment includes opioids, gabapentin, NMDA antagonists like ketamine and memantine, and antidepressants. Nonpharmacologic techniques include biofeedback, mirror therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and spinal cord or peripheral nerve stimulation.</p>
<p class="h7"><strong><em>Cancer Pain</em></strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Cancer pain is common in up to 90% of patients with advanced disease. It can be somatic pain, which responds well to opioids, NSAIDs, and neural blockade; visceral pain, which responds well to sympathetic blocks; or neuropathic pain, which is best treated with opioids, SNRIs, antiepileptics, and TCAs. Although opioids are the mainstay of treatment for cancer-related pain, management should include a combination of pharmacologic agents, antineoplastic treatment (chemotherapy, radiation), medicinal marijuana, interventional procedures as necessary, and psychological care.<sup><a href="#bib14">14</a></sup></p>
<h6 class="h6">Neurolytic Blocks for Visceral Pain From Cancer</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The abdominal organs, with the exception of the descending colon, are innervated by the <strong><em>celiac plexus</em></strong>, which lies on the anterior surface of the aorta at L1. The celiac plexus is made up of sympathetic fibers from the greater, lesser, and least splanchnic nerves, as well as parasympathetic fibers from the vagus nerve. Reduction of pain from the abdominal organs, such as that associated with pancreatic cancer, can be accomplished by the blockade of the splanchnic nerves at the anterior margin of T12 or the retrocrural or anterocrural blockade of the plexus anterior to the L1 vertebral body. Fluoroscopic or CT guidance is mandatory. Alcohol (50%-100%) or phenol (6% aqueous) is used to coagulate the target nerves, allowing for weeks to months of pain relief before the nerves regenerate. Complications can include orthostatic hypotension, transient diarrhea, aortic dissection, back pain, retroperitoneal hematoma, hematuria, pleurisy, hiccups, and paraplegia.</p>
<p class="indent">The superior hypogastric plexus, a continuation of the sympathetic chain, innervate the pelvic organs. It is located anterior to the L5-S1 disk space and can be blocked bilaterally or with a single-needle transdiscally.</p>
<p class="indent">The perineal area, including the distal rectum, anus, vulva, distal vagina, and distal urethra, are innervated via the ganglion impar, the termination of the sympathetic chain. It is a midline structure located anterior to the sacrococcygeal junction. The transcoccygeal approach is most commonly employed, wherein a needle is placed through the sacrococcygeal ligament until its tip is just anterior to the distal sacrum; care must be taken to avoid rectal puncture.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Interventional Procedures</h6>
<p class="h7"><strong>Minimally Invasive Lumbar Decompression Procedure</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The minimally invasive lumbar decompression procedure is indicated to treat spinal stenosis related to ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. An epidural needle is placed and an epidurogram is performed, followed by contouring of the lamina and partial debulking of the hypertrophic ligamentum flavum. This partially decompresses the central canal and alleviates symptoms of back pain and neurogenic claudication attributed to disproportionate ligamentum hypertrophy.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><a id="page816"></a>Vertebroplasty and Kyphoplasty</h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Vertebroplasty</em></strong> and <strong><em>kyphoplasty</em></strong> are procedures to treat painful vertebral body compression fractures, usually due to osteoporosis. In both procedures, trocars are inserted percutaneously into the fractured vertebral body, either through the pedicle or extrapedicular approach. In kyphoplasty, a balloon is inflated within the vertebral body fracture to restore height and correct the kyphotic defect. The cavity created after balloon inflation is then filled with cement. In vertebroplasty, the cement is injected directly into the fractured trabeculae without balloon augmentation. In both procedures, the patient remains supine for several hours post intervention to observe neurologic status. Complications can include hematoma, cement leakage into vasculature resulting in pulmonary embolism, and retropulsion of bone fragments or cement into the spinal canal causing neurologic deficit. Long-term sequelae can include return of pain and fracture at an adjacent vertebral level.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Neuromodulation</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Spinal cord stimulation</em></strong> involves placement of electrodes within the midline posterior epidural space along the dorsal columns. Electrical stimulation of these tracts can cause paresthesias, masking the sensation of pain. The most commonly postulated theory is modulation of gate control. The stimulator increases the output of larger A<em>&#x03B2;</em> fibers responsible for the sensation of touch. These A<em>&#x03B2;</em> fibers cause excitation of interneurons in the substantia gelatinosa, which inhibit transmission of signals from smaller pain-mediating C fibers, thereby &#x201C;closing the gate.&#x201D; The characteristics of electrical pulses and waveforms necessary to form paresthesias can be defined using terminology common to wave theory: frequency, amplitude, and pulse width. By manipulating these parameters, differing electrical waves can be generated and applied to the dorsal columns, thereby enhancing therapeutic options. Early spinal cord stimulator devices provided tonic, constant low-frequency (20-120&#x00A0;Hz) stimulation, to the dorsal columns between the perception (amplitude of stimulation first detected by patient) and discomfort (amplitude where paresthesias became noxious) threshold. Newer therapeutic strategies have been developed focusing on higher frequency and/or burst stimulation. In high-frequency stimulation, up to 10&#x00A0;KHz can be delivered to spinal tracts, resulting in near paresthesia-free stimulation. By altering frequency, different neuronal pathways can be activated, and at 1000&#x00A0;Hz, afferent sensory neuron conduction was altered compared to 50&#x00A0;Hz stimulation. Burst stimulation combines higher frequency stimulation at 500&#x00A0;Hz along with increased pulse width of the pulse waves to create paresthesia-free stimulation. It is theorized this pattern of stimulation is more replicative of endogenous neuronal firing.<sup><a href="#bib15">15</a>,<a href="#bib16">16</a></sup> Spinal cord stimulation may help control symptoms and reduce opioid usage in patients with failed back surgery syndrome, neuropathic pain, CRPS, angina, and chronic limb ischemia. Patients should first undergo a psychological screening process to determine appropriateness for therapy and have excellent pain relief from temporary trial leads prior to permanent implantation. Trial leads may be implanted percutaneously in an outpatient clinic and are typically left in 5 to 7&#x00A0;days. Permanent leads may be implanted percutaneously or via laminectomy. The leads exit the epidural space and are tunneled to a battery implanted subcutaneously. Complications of SCS can be stratified into hardware-related issues, such as lead migration, fracture, disconnection, pulse generator pain, implantable pulse generator (IPG) flipping, and charging <a id="page817"></a>difficulties; or biologic issues, such as superficial or deep infection, seroma, hematoma, wound dehiscence, or rarely dural puncture and spinal cord/spinal nerve injury.<sup><a href="#bib17">17</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Focal areas of truncal or lower extremity pain may not be amenable to coverage with traditional SCS, and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation has emerged as a viable alternative for these refractory pain syndromes. The procedure involves epidural placement of electrodes adjacent to the DRG, within the posterosuperior neuroforamen. The DRG houses the cell bodies of sensory neurons, and stimulation of the DRG is thought to modulate neuronal excitability responsible for neuropathic pain transmission. DRG stimulation has shown efficacy for lower extremity neuropathic pain, CRPS, PHN, and postherniorrhaphy pain. Risks of the procedure are similar to conventional SCS, with higher risk of lead fracture, migration, and unique risks of motor stimulation and possible spinal nerve injury if the neuroforamen is stenotic.<sup><a href="#bib18">18</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) is indicated to treat pain originating from a single peripheral nerve. Unlike DRG or conventional SCS, PNS can be utilized anywhere a peripheral nerve can be isolated. Leads are implanted using fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance to lie adjacent to the painful nerve. The mechanism of peripheral nerve stimulation is thought to involve gate control theory but at the level of the peripheral nerve. Through direct electrical stimulation of larger A<em>&#x03B2;</em> fibers within sensory afferents, pain-mediated C-fiber activation is blunted at the level of the spinal interneuron.<sup><a href="#bib19">19</a></sup></p>
<h6 class="h6">Intrathecal Drug Delivery</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Intrathecal drug delivery systems, or intrathecal pumps, consist of an intrathecal catheter tunneled under the skin to an internalized pump and drug reservoir. Infused medications may include opioids, bupivacaine, and clonidine. Ziconotide is used for neuropathic pain, and baclofen is indicated for spasticity. The most common opioids used are morphine, hydromorphone, and fentanyl. Intrathecal opioids are indicated in malignant pain when oral and transdermal opioids have failed to provide adequate relief despite appropriate dosing or when side effects limit upward titration of opioids. Medications are placed in the spinal fluid, bypassing the blood-brain barrier and allowing for much lower effective doses and an improved side effect profile. Side effects can include respiratory depression, headache, pruritus, peripheral edema, intrathecal catheter granuloma formation, and hormone disruption. Intrathecal catheter granuloma formation involves the development of an inflammatory mass near the catheter tip, attributed to alterations of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, and this can cause direct compression of spinal cord contents prompting surgical intervention. Duration of intrathecal therapy is a known risk factor for granuloma formation; other possible risk factors include previous history of spinal surgery, spinal cord injury, and a higher association with hydromorphone infusions.<sup><a href="#bib20">20</a>,<a href="#bib21">21</a></sup></p>
