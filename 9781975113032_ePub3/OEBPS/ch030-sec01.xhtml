<p class="nonindent">The adult brain accounts for only 2% of total body weight but 20% of total body oxygen consumption. The different regions of the brain and spinal cord are responsible for distinct functions (<strong><a href="ch030-sec02.xhtml#tt30-1">Table 30.1</a></strong>). Blood flow to the brain is accomplished by two carotid arteries anteriorly (70%) and two vertebral arteries posteriorly (forming the basilar artery) (30%), which subsequently converge to form an anastomotic ring at the base of the skull known as the circle of Willis (<strong><a href="ch030-sec02.xhtml#ff30-1">Figure 30.1</a></strong>). The spinal column is composed of 33 vertebrae (7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, and 9 fused sacral and coccygeal), with nerve roots leaving the enclosed spinal cord and exiting through corresponding intervertebral foramina. The blood supply to the spinal cord entails one anterior spinal artery and two posterior spinal arteries. The anterior spinal artery originates from radicular arteries branching off the aorta, with the largest one being the artery of Adamkiewicz (usually at L1 or L2). The posterior spinal arteries originate from the posterior cerebral circulation (<strong><a href="ch030-sec02.xhtml#ff30-2">Figure 30.2</a></strong>). The spinal cord itself terminates at L1 or L2 in adults, ending in structures known as the conus medullaris terminus and filum terminale.</p>
