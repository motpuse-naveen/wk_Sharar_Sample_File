<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The primary survey and initial resuscitation of the severely injured patient follow the ABCDE acronym: Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability (neurologic function), and Exposure (completely expose and examine the patient so that no injury is missed).</p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent">Traumatic injury is the leading cause of death worldwide, particularly in younger age groups, potentially causing a significant number of life years lost. The treatment of seriously injured patients is time-sensitive and best accomplished by an interdisciplinary team approach, with anesthesia providers being responsible for airway/ventilation management and assisting with vascular access, fluid/blood resuscitation, sedation, and blood pressure control.</p>
<p class="indent">Severely injured patients will more likely require fast transport to the operating room for definitive surgical care. Having anesthesia at the bedside in the emergency room (ER) to facilitate such transport is beneficial. In some instances, the direct admission of a trauma patient to the operating room and bypassing the ER may also reduce the time to definitive care.</p>
<p class="indent">To facilitate a systematic thinking process and understanding between various specialty providers, the American College of Surgeons&#x2019; <strong><em>Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS)</em></strong> approach is commonly used to assess and care for injured patients. In short, ATLS management consists of the <strong><em>primary survey</em></strong> (identification of life-threatening injuries with simultaneous resuscitation), the <strong><em>secondary survey</em></strong> (comprehensive assessment of all other injuries and associated conditions), and <strong><em>definitive care</em></strong> (medical, surgical, or critical care). Here, we will focus on the primary survey and resuscitation known by the mnemonic ABCDE.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen534">A. Airway Management With Restriction of Cervical Spine Motion</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Assessing and securing the airway is the first step of the primary survey. Rapid assessment is done by asking patients simple questions. Patients who can speak usually have a patent airway and do not immediately require airway management. For more comprehensive assessment, <a href="ch020.xhtml">Chapter 20</a> provides details of airway management in elective and emergent settings.</p>
<p class="indent">Standard methods of airway assessment (<a href="ch020-sec03.xhtml#tt20-4">Tables 20.4</a>-<a href="ch020-sec03.xhtml#tt20-6">20.6</a>; <a href="ch020-sec03.xhtml#ff20-3">Figure 20.3</a>) can be limited in the trauma setting by lack of patient cooperation. This makes visual inspection of the face and neck the mainstay of such assessment. A short, fat neck with fewer than three fingerbreadths from the thyroid notch to the jaw tip (ie, thyromental distance) is concerning for a potentially difficult airway. Obvious facial asymmetry further suggests an underlying anatomic abnormality, be it traumatic, congenital, or neoplastic. Limited neck range of motion&#x2014;whether from preexisting conditions or cervical spine immobilization&#x2014;further suggests a more challenging airway. The modified LEMON criteria (<strong><a href="#tt32-1">Table 32.1</a></strong>) can be used to predict a potentially difficult airway.</p>

<p class="indent">The presence of a &#x201C;full stomach&#x201D; and high aspiration risk should be assumed for all trauma patients. Thus, rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is generally performed. If possible, secure intravenous (IV) or intraosseous (IO) access and preoxygenation should be ensured before any airway manipulation starts.</p>
<p class="indent">Cricoid pressure (CP) is commonly applied as part of the RSI protocol, with the objective of preventing gastric aspiration. However, the evidence supporting CP benefit is controversial and also suggests it may worsen laryngoscopic view.<sup><a href="ch032-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> Maintenance of CP during active vomiting risks esophageal injury; therefore, CP is not intended to prevent aspiration in a vomiting patient, but rather to prevent passive reflux of gastric contents into the pharynx. In fact, if a patient begins to vomit, one must release CP, turn the patient on their side (if possible), and suction the emesis.</p>
<p class="indent">Until the diagnosis of cervical spinal injury is excluded, the spine should be protected from excessive movement that might result in new or worsening spinal cord injury (SCI). <strong><em>Manual in-line stabilization (MILS)</em></strong> of the cervical spine is routinely used in emergency airway management of trauma patients at risk for cervical spine and/or cord injury. However, cadaveric studies have shown that MILS does not ensure spine immobility. Rigid adherence to MILS or CP in the context of a poor view of the vocal cords can increase the difficulty and duration of tracheal intubation; therefore, relaxation of MILS or CP must be considered in the context of the overall clinical picture that prioritizes securing the airway.</p>
<p class="indent">Mask ventilation and tracheal intubation can both be challenging in trauma patients due to head and neck injuries, recent oral intake that increases aspiration risk, and/or possible lung injury that can negatively impact both oxygenation and ventilation. Adherence to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) difficult airway algorithm is essential (see <a href="appx004.xhtml">Appendix D</a>), including planning and preparation of multiple backup airway management techniques. In patients with severe traumatic injury, however, case cancellation is rarely an option. If the intubation attempt fails, it is indicated to transition rapidly to an emergency surgical airway (cricothyrotomy, tracheostomy), as most trauma patients have limited reserve and will not tolerate prolonged intubation attempts (<strong><a href="#ff32-1">Figure 32.1</a></strong>).</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen535"><a id="page682"></a>B. Breathing/Ventilation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Respiratory assessment is a critical component of the primary survey because several pathologies may alter oxygenation and/or ventilation after trauma. Conditions that are life-threatening and often require immediate attention are tension pneumothorax, massive hemothorax, open pneumothorax, and tracheobronchial injuries. Generally, all injured patients should receive supplemental oxygen and monitoring of oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. Indications for tracheal intubation include obvious respiratory distress, inability to speak in complete sentences, an elevated respiratory rate, poor oxygenation, poor ventilation, or significant <strong><em>traumatic brain injury (TBI)</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
<p class="indent">Patients who arrive with any type of airway device placed prior to hospital arrival must be immediately evaluated to ensure proper position and function of the device. End-tidal carbon dioxide and the presence of bilateral breath sounds should be evaluated and documented. Supraglottic airway devices such as the King LT (King System, Noblesville, IN) airway, Combitube (Moore Medical, Farmington, CT), or laryngeal masks do not protect the airway from aspiration of stomach contents, blood, saliva, or tooth fragments. They should be replaced with a cuffed endotracheal tube as soon as possible. A gastric tube should also be placed soon after tracheal intubation to deflate the stomach. This can further mitigate the risk of aspiration and improve both venous return and blood pressure by decreasing both intra-abdominal pressure and pressure against the vena cava. However, nasogastric tube placement is contraindicated in midface or basilar skull fractures, as the tube could potentially enter the cranium.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen536">C. Circulation and Hemorrhage Control</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Shock is defined as inadequate tissue perfusion. Blood loss (hypovolemia) is the most common cause of shock in trauma patients. Other, less common causes for hypotension in trauma patients include tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, and SCI.</p>
<p class="indent">Delayed capillary refill, cold and &#x201C;clammy&#x201D; skin, impaired mentation, and oliguria are classic signs that most often suggest <strong><em>hemorrhagic shock</em></strong>. Blood pressure and heart rate can help provide more quantifiable assessment of systemic perfusion and shock. For example, low blood pressure is typically compensated for with an elevated heart rate (see <a href="ch003.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>). The Assessment of Blood Consumption score (<strong><a href="#tt32-2">Table 32.2</a></strong>) is a useful tool to determine the likelihood of hemorrhagic shock and the associated need for early massive blood transfusion.</p>
<p class="indent">The immediate treatment goals for hemorrhagic shock are to stop ongoing bleeding and restore tissue perfusion by replacing intravascular volume and oxygen carrying capacity (see <a href="ch024.xhtml">Chapter 24</a>). Placement of temporary tourniquets on a limb with life-threatening bleeding is a simple and effective hemostasis measure. In cases of significant pelvic trauma and retroperitoneal bleeding, placement of a <strong><em>pelvic binder</em></strong> can reapproximate pelvic fractures and temporarily limit internal blood loss. Ultimately, the priority is rapid transportation to the operating room or angiography suite for definitive control of internal or external bleeding.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen537">D. Disability (Neurologic Evaluation and Management)</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A prompt neurologic evaluation during the primary survey is important for establishing a baseline examination for future treatments. An understanding of the <strong><em>Glasgow coma scale</em></strong> (GCS) score (see <a href="ch030.xhtml">Chapter 30</a>, Table 30.2) is critical to rapidly evaluate and quantify the mental status and motor function of trauma patients. It also guides the need for tracheal intubation in patients with TBI. Of note, the iris contains no nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; therefore, neuromuscular blocking agents do not affect pupil size.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">TBI is the leading cause of death in trauma. Any suspicion of TBI should be evaluated with a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head to identify primary injuries (eg, intracranial hematoma) that require immediate surgery or specialized critical care. Throughout the primary survey, however, priority is given to maintaining adequate blood pressure and oxygenation to avoid <strong><em>secondary brain injury</em></strong> due to neuronal ischemia. In patients with severe TBI defined as GCS of 3 to 8, guidelines from the Brain Trauma Foundation recommend that systolic blood pressure be &#x2265;100&#x00A0;mm Hg for patients 50 to 69&#x00A0;years old or at &#x2265;110&#x00A0;mm Hg for patients 15 to 49 or more than 70&#x00A0;years old. Even transient reductions in blood pressure or oxygen saturation can profoundly affect the mortality of these patients.<sup><a href="ch032-sec05.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup> Perioperative anesthetic management of TBI is discussed in detail in <a href="ch030.xhtml">Chapter 30</a>.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The 15-point Glasgow coma scale requires cooperative motor responses and verbal skills that are found in older children and adults, but not in younger children or infants; thus, a similar, but modified 15-point pediatric Glasgow coma scale is available and should be used in preverbal children and infants.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In patients who have sustained a <strong><em>spinal cord injury (SCI)</em></strong>, it is important to assess the anatomic level of the neurologic deficit as soon as possible. Sensory level is determined by dermatome level of touch or pain. Motor function is assessed using the American Spinal Injury Association score (see <a href="ch026.xhtml">Chapter 26</a>, <a href="ch026-sec03.xhtml#tt26-1">Table 26.1</a>). Assessment of anal sphincter tone is also an important component of the motor examination.</p>
<p class="indent">Methylprednisolone administration, once a standard practice aimed to improve neurologic recovery in SCI patients, was found by recent literature to be associated with negative outcomes such as infection, but with questionable benefit. Thus, the practice is no longer recommended by practice guidelines.<sup><a href="ch032-sec05.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Initial management of suspected SCI includes placement of a rigid cervical collar and strict mobility precautions to minimize spinal motion, particularly in patients with intoxication or TBI when it is challenging to rule out SCI. These patients should remain in a cervical collar until definitive imaging can be performed. Clearance of cervical SCI is only recommended after a negative high-quality C-spine CT scan result<sup><a href="ch032-sec05.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> and preferably after patient can range the neck without any neurologic deficit.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen538">E. Exposure and Environment Control</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The last step of the primary survey is to examine the patient&#x2019;s entire body (including the back) in order to avoid missing any injuries. To evaluate major vascular injury, presence and character of peripheral pulses, as well as skin color and temperature, should be assessed. A cool and poorly perfused limb must be immediately evaluated for possible arterial injury and revascularization. Concurrently, measures to avoid hypothermia should be applied as this can worsen peripheral perfusion and coagulopathy, as well as increase mortality.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page684"></a>After the primary survey is complete, a more detailed history, physical examination, and investigations should be taken to identify any remaining injuries and formulate definitive treatment plans according to urgency of each condition.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen539">F. Interdisciplinary, Team-Based Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Crew resource management</em></strong> is a concept developed by the aviation industry in which each member of the multidisciplinary team has equal responsibility for passenger safety. For example, any member of a flight crew can alert the pilot in command of a potential hazard. This concept is particularly relevant to trauma, when care is necessarily multidisciplinary and critical events must occur concurrently in a timely fashion. Central to the concept of crew resource management is clear and free communication between all parties, regardless of hierarchy. When several events and therapies must occur simultaneously, it can be valuable to use a checklist to ensure that no critical steps are overlooked.<sup><a href="ch032-sec05.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup> The recommended checklist for trauma and emergency anesthesia is shown in <strong><a href="ch032-sec02.xhtml#ff32-2">Figure 32.2</a></strong>. Assigning predetermined positions to members of the anesthetic resuscitation team is also an effective way to maintain organization in the trauma operating room (<strong><a href="ch032-sec02.xhtml#ff32-3">Figure 32.3</a></strong>).</p>
