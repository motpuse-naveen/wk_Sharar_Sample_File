<h5 class="h5" id="sen100">A. Terminology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The behavior of administered drugs is best described in terms of <strong><em>pharmacodynamics</em></strong> (what the drug does to the body) and <strong><em>pharmacokinetics</em></strong> (what the body does to the drug). Pharmacodynamics describes the effects of drugs on organ systems, tissues, and specific receptors. Pharmacokinetics describes the way in which drugs are absorbed upon their administration, their distribution within various body compartments, their metabolism, and their elimination or excretion.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen101">B. Classification of Inhaled Anesthetics</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Some inhaled anesthetics are in a gaseous state at room temperature and are stored in tanks. Examples of such anesthetic gases include nitrous oxide, xenon, and an explosive gas, cyclopropane, which is no longer in use. Most inhaled anesthetics in current use are termed volatile anesthetics because they are liquids at room temperature. These are stored in bottles and converted to a gas phase using special agent-specific vaporizers that can deliver a precise concentration of the drug into the anesthetic circuit. Outdated examples of volatile anesthetics include diethyl ether, halothane, and enflurane. Current volatile anesthetics include sevoflurane and isoflurane. Desflurane is an inhaled anesthetic that has characteristics of both a pure gas and a volatile anesthetic. That is, because its boiling point is 24 &#x00B0;C, it changes from a liquid to a gas at a temperature very near normal room temperature. Vaporization of desflurane requires a vaporizer that is more complex than is necessary for the other volatile anesthetics. For example, the desflurane vaporizer requires electrical power to operate, and the desflurane liquid within is kept pressurized in order to prevent spontaneous boiling.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen102">C. Physical Characteristics of Inhaled Anesthetics</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><a href="#tt8-1">Table 8.1</a></strong> describes some of the properties of inhaled anesthetic agents currently in use. A <strong><em>partition coefficient</em></strong> (eg, blood:gas or brain:blood) is expressed in various media as the solubility of these anesthetics. If a container with equal<a id="page152"></a> volumes of blood and air was exposed to enough isoflurane to produce a 1% concentration of isoflurane in the gas phase (1&#x00A0;mL isoflurane/100&#x00A0;mL of air) and allowed to come to equilibrium (total pressure equal in both air and blood), then 1.46&#x00A0;mL of isoflurane would be dissolved in each 100&#x00A0;mL of blood. The isoflurane would be &#x201C;partitioned&#x201D; between the blood and air in a ratio of 1.46:1, so the partition coefficient would be 1.46.</p>

<p class="indent">The <strong><em>blood:gas</em></strong> partition coefficient determines the speed of anesthetic induction, recovery, and change of anesthetic depth. An agent with a relatively high blood:gas partition coefficient (eg, isoflurane&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;1.46) will require a longer time for induction (and recovery) compared with an anesthetic with a lower blood:gas partition coefficient (eg, sevoflurane&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;0.65). Anesthesia results when the anesthetic is fully dissolved in the blood and an effective partial pressure of the anesthetic is attained in the blood (and brain). It takes longer for induction of anesthesia with an anesthetic with a high blood:gas partition coefficient because more anesthetic is dissolved in blood. And it takes longer for the blood to become &#x201C;saturated&#x201D; and the partial pressure exerted by the anesthetic to be high enough to produce a surgical level of anesthesia.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><em>oil:gas</em></strong> partition coefficient is a measure of lipid solubility of an inhaled anesthetic. The higher the oil:gas partition coefficient, the more potent the anesthetic and the lower the partial pressure (ie, concentration) required to achieve a surgical plane of anesthesia (see the following section for a discussion of the minimum alveolar concentration).</p>
