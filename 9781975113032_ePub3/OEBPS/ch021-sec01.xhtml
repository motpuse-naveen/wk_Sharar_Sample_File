<h4 class="h4" id="sec123">I. General Principles and Equipment</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Utilized alone or in conjunction with general anesthesia, regional anesthesia provides clinicians vital tools to reduce pain after various types of painful surgeries. Not only do these techniques improve patient satisfaction, but they also serve to decrease postoperative complications such as nausea, respiratory depression, and recovery room time. Application of regional anesthesia requires knowledge of indications, contraindications, and local anesthetic pharmacology as well as practiced technical skills before it can be offered. This chapter will briefly review basic concepts of peripheral nerve blockade prior to describing specific block technique for some commonly performed blocks.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen319">A. Setup and Monitoring</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Peripheral nerve blocks</em></strong> are often performed outside of the operating room, typically preoperatively so that they may take effect prior to surgical incision. They must be performed with the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) standard monitors including pulse oximetry, continuous electrocardiogram, and blood pressure cuff. If mild sedation is used, oxygen should be applied via nasal cannula. A &#x201C;block cart&#x201D; should be in the immediate vicinity and contain airway equipment, emergency supplies, and medications, such as lipid emulsion.</p>

<p class="dify">Ultrasound guidance has not definitively been proven to be safer or more effective, yet evidence is emerging showing that ultrasound allows for faster onset, lower doses of local anesthetics, and fewer needle passes.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen320">B. Peripheral Nerve Stimulators</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A peripheral nerve stimulator can be used to identify nerves and guide placement of local anesthetic, with or without ultrasound. An insulted needle that only allows the tip of the needle to conduct electric current must be used for this purpose. The closer the tip of the needle is to a nerve, the less current is required to stimulate it. Dose ranges are typically 0.1 to 1mA for elicited motor response (EMR). Longer duration impulses (&#x003E;0.3&#x00A0;ms) are more likely to cause pain by stimulating sensory nerves, while shorter duration impulses (0.1&#x00A0;ms) cause significantly less discomfort because the motor component of the nerve is primarily stimulated.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen321">C. Ultrasound Guidance</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The prevalence of <strong><em>ultrasound guidance</em></strong> has increased the popularity of regional anesthesia. Ultrasound allows for the visualization of nerve structures, vascular structures, and local anesthetic spread. Ultrasound guidance has not definitively been proven to be safer or more effective, yet evidence is emerging showing that ultrasound allows for faster onset, lower doses of local anesthetics, and fewer needle passes.<sup><a href="ch021-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> To obtain the optimal view of a target nerve, a basic understanding of ultrasound physics is useful.</p>
<p class="indent">Ultrasound beams are sound waves beyond the threshold of hearing (&#x003E;20,000&#x00A0;MHz). Images are created when these waves are reflected back to the <a id="page445"></a>sensor (located within the probe) and then processed by a computer. <strong><em>Acoustic impedance</em></strong> is the quality of structures allowing for visualization using ultrasound. Differences in acoustic impedance of a structure relative to its surrounding tissue dictate whether the structure will be visible. Certain structures are more likely to attenuate an ultrasound beam. For example, ultrasound waves pass easily through blood vessels (ie, minimal attenuation), compared with bone and air, which cause a high degree of attenuation.</p>

<p class="indent">Probes differ in frequency ranges. Higher frequency probes have less penetration but greater resolution and are useful for superficial structures, including most peripheral nerves. Lower frequency probes are useful for deeper structures such as the heart and liver.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the appropriate depth is set when viewing an ultrasound image, the <em>gain</em> can be adjusted to brighten or darken the image. Color flow Doppler can help to identify blood vessels due to the turbulent nature of blood flow toward and away from the probe.</p>

<p class="dify">Higher frequency ultrasound probes have less penetration but greater resolution and are therefore useful for visualizing superficial structures including most peripheral nerves.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">When orienting the needle to the probe, two different techniques have been defined: in plane versus out of plane (<strong><a href="#ff21-1">Figure 21.1</a></strong>). The benefit of an in-plane approach is that it allows for the entire needle, including the tip, to be visualized at all times.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen322">D. Other Related Equipment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Insulated needles must be used when nerve stimulation is desired. Needles designed for peripheral nerve blocks are usually short beveled to decrease the likelihood of injuring nerves and vascular structures, in contrast to long-beveled needles intended for intramuscular injections. Although a standard insulated needle can be seen with ultrasound, specifically produced hyperechoic needles are considerably easier to view.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>

<p class="dify">The best needles to use for peripheral nerve blocks are insulated, short beveled, and hyperechoic needles.</p>
