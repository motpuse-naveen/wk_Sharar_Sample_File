<h5 class="h5" id="sen88">A. Drug Absorption and Routes of Drug Administration</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Irrespective of the route of administration, all drugs must cross one or more cell membranes to exert their action. There are three kinds of transport processes by which drugs enter a cell:</p>
<ul class="bblue"><li><span><strong><em>Passive diffusion</em></strong><strong>:</strong> Drugs move across the cell membrane along a concentration gradient, and hence, the process does not consume energy.</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Active transport</em></strong><strong>:</strong> Drugs are moved against a concentration gradient from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration. This requires cellular energy, and the process is specific and saturable. It is not a common mode of transport for drug molecules, but examples include levodopa and propylthiouracil.</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Facilitated diffusion</em></strong><strong>:</strong> This is passive diffusion across cell membrane involving a membrane protein. As drug molecules are moving along a concentration gradient, energy is not consumed. However, the process is carrier-mediated, specific, and saturable like active transport.</span></li></ul>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen89">B. Drug Distribution, Elimination, and Biotransformation</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>1. Drug Distribution</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Drug distribution is determined by cardiac output and the blood flow to individual organs. The vessel-rich organs, which receive most of the cardiac output (brain, lungs, heart, liver, and kidneys), quickly equilibrate with the drug concentration in plasma in a matter of minutes. Organs with lower perfusion, such as muscles, are the next group to equilibrate. The last organs to reach equilibrium are those with very poor perfusion, such as adipose tissue and vessel-poor organs such as bone. In all organs, the uptake of the drug is primarily limited by perfusion flow rather than local transport.<sup><a href="ch007-sec03.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup></p>

</div>
<p class="indent">After intravenous injection, most lipophilic drugs undergo redistribution to vessel-rich organs, such as the brain, and equilibrate with the brain in a few minutes. Further drug uptake organs like muscle then lowers the plasma drug concentration. This causes a reverse gradient relative to the drug concentration in the brain, and some drug diffuses back out of the brain into plasma. The plasma concentration continues to fall as the vessel-poor organs continue to take up the drug. For most anesthesia induction agents, the action of the drug is primarily terminated by this process of redistribution of the drug from the brain, rather than by elimination of the drug from the body.</p>
<a id="page133"></a>
<p class="indent">Drug absorption plays a vital role in determining plasma drug concentrations for all routes of drug administration other than intravenous injection. Rapid absorption of a drug results in rapid onset of action and slow absorption allows a long duration of action. The rate of absorption depends on solubility and concentration of the drug. Incomplete absorption limits the amount of the drug that can become present at the drug&#x2019;s effect site.</p>
<h6 class="h6">2. Drug Elimination</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The process of elimination entails either primary renal elimination or biotransformative reactions in the liver followed by renal excretion. Elimination or clearance describes the rate at which a drug is eliminated from the body, expressed as being equivalent to the volume of blood from which the drug is completely and irreversibly removed within a unit period of time. Elimination Clearance therefore has dimensions of volume/time.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The decrease in plasma concentration and the termination of effect of intravenous anesthetic induction agents is primarily caused by redistribution.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hepatic drug clearance</em></strong> is the volume of the blood flowing through the liver that is cleared of the drug in unit time. It is determined by the amount of drug delivered to the liver, which in turn is determined by hepatic blood flow and the intrinsic ability of the liver to metabolize the drug. The factors affecting hepatic clearance are hepatic artery blood flow, portal vein blood flow, intrinsic ability to metabolize the drug, and protein binding of the drug. Hepatic extraction ratio (HER) is the volume of blood from which the drug is irreversibly removed during one pass of blood through the liver. It is the ratio of hepatic clearance to hepatic blood flow. For drugs with low intrinsic clearance, HER is determined by hepatic blood flow.</p>
<p class="indent">HER &#x003E;0.7 is considered high; 0.3 to 0.7 is intermediate; and &#x003C;0.3 is low. Rowland equation<sup><a href="ch007-sec03.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup> defines the hepatic clearance <em>CL</em><sub>H</sub> as follows:</p>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/133-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="nonindent">where:</p>
<p class="UL1a"><em>Q</em><sub>H</sub>&#x2014;hepatic blood flow</p>
<p class="UL1"><em>f</em><sub>u</sub>&#x2014;fraction of free drug</p>
<p class="UL1"><em>CL</em><sub>i</sub>&#x2014;intrinsic capacity of hepatocytes to metabolize the drug</p>
<p class="indent1">These relationships are depicted in <strong><a href="#ff7-1">Figure 7.1</a></strong>. The relative HERs of some commonly used drugs in the perioperative period are as follows:</p>
<ul class="bblue"><li><span><strong><em>Drugs with low HER</em></strong>: Diazepam, lorazepam, methadone, rocuronium, phenytoin.</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Drugs with intermediate HER</em></strong>: Midazolam, alfentanil, vecuronium.</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Drugs with high HER</em></strong>: fentanyl, ketamine, propofol, morphine, naloxone, lidocaine, bupivacaine.</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">It follows that when changes in the cardiac output result in changes in hepatic and renal blood flow, the metabolism of drugs with high hepatic extraction ratio and subsequent renal clearance are adversely affected. In states of decreased cardiac output (eg, heart failure), the hepatic clearance of drugs with high HER is decreased.<sup><a href="ch007-sec03.xhtml#bib3">3</a>,<a href="ch007-sec03.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> In contrast, renal autoregulation tends to maintain renal perfusion pressure and so a relatively constant renal elimination clearance is seen until the capacity for autoregulation is exceeded.</p>

For drugs with a high intrinsic clearance (<em>CL</em><sub>i</sub>&#x00A0;&#x003E;&#x00A0;Q), increasing intrinsic, clearance has little effect on hepatic extraction, and total hepatic clearance approaches hepatic blood flow.

<h6 class="h6">3. Biotransformation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Drug molecules may undergo biotransformation by enzymatic reactions in the body. Most of these reactions occur in the liver and can result in any of the following outcomes:</p>
<ul class="bblue"><li><span>Inactive compounds for elimination</span></li>
<li><span>A less active compound</span></li>
<li><span>Transformation of a prodrug to an active drug molecule</span></li>
<li><span>Formation of toxic metabolites</span></li></ul>
<p class="indent">Hydrophilic compounds are excreted unchanged into urine and stool. Less hydrophilic compounds need to be metabolized into more hydrophilic compounds to enable their excretion in urine. This metabolism occurs via phase I and phase II reactions.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">CYP3A accounts for 40% to 45% of all CYP-mediated drug metabolism. Phenytoin shortens the action of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants by inducing CYP3A and hence increasing the elimination clearance of the muscle relaxants.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Phase I reactions include hydrolysis, oxidation, and reduction, which make the drug molecules more susceptible to phase II reactions. Hydrolysis is the process of insertion of a water molecule into the drug, enabling the cleavage of the drug into two molecules. Amide local anesthetics and esters undergo metabolism by hydrolysis. Oxidation involves reactions where electrons are removed from a compound. This is an enzymatically mediated reaction where a hydroxyl group (&#x2212;OH) is inserted into the drug molecule. The hydroxylated compound is usually unstable and splits into separate molecules. Reductions are reactions wherein electrons are added to a compound. The cytochrome P450 family of enzymes in the liver are predominantly involved in biotransformation reactions and catalyze most Phase I reactions. CYP3A4 is the most important of these, accounting for 40% to 45% of all CYP-mediated drug metabolism. High concentrations of these enzymes are<a id="page135"></a> found in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes and on the membranes of upper intestinal enterocytes. These enzymes can in turn be induced or inhibited by other drugs. The phase II reactions produce conjugates that are polar, water-soluble compounds which can be easily excreted via kidneys or hepatobiliary secretion.</p>
<p class="indent">Enzymes involved in phase I and phase II reactions have several isoforms. Genetic variability affects the expression of these isoforms, affecting the rate of these biotransformation reactions. For example, different genotypes result in either normal, low, or absent plasma cholinesterase activity, accounting for the differences in response to succinylcholine (metabolized by plasma cholinesterase) among individuals. Genetic polymorphism is exhibited by the CYP-P450 enzyme system and various transferases involved in phase II reactions.<sup><a href="ch007-sec03.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Genetic mutations on the chromosome coding for pseudocholinesterase may prolong the effect of succinylcholine from 2 to 4 minutes, up to 4 to 6 hours.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">4. Renal Elimination</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The kidneys excrete hydrophilic compounds and the hydrophilic metabolites of lipophilic compounds into urine. This occurs by passive glomerular filtration or by active secretion into the renal tubules. The effective renal clearance of the drug is the sum of the drug filtered by the glomeruli and actively excreted into renal tubules, minus the amount of drug that gets resorbed from the renal tubules. Drugs with significant renal excretion in perioperative practice are penicillin, cephalosporins, pancuronium, rocuronium, aminoglycosides, and neostigmine.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen90">C. Pharmacokinetic Concepts</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>1. First Order, Zero Order, and Nonlinear Processes</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">A pharmacokinetic process whose rate is directly proportional to the concentration of the drug present is said to have <strong><em>first-order kinetics</em></strong>. As the concentration of the drug increases, the rate of the process increases. The usual terminology used to define the rapidity of pharmacokinetics is &#x201C;half-lives&#x201D; (<em>t</em><sub>1/2</sub>)</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">For a first-order reaction, the concentration of the drug decreases by a constant with each half-life and is independent of its concentration in plasma.</p>
</div>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/135-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="nonindent">where <em>V</em><sub>d</sub> is the volume of distribution and <em>CL</em> is the clearance. As the rate of elimination increases, <em>t</em><sub>1/2</sub> decreases. Half-life is the time required for the plasma concentration of a drug to decrease by 50%. For the process of elimination, most of drug is therefore removed from the plasma in 4 to 5 half-lives. The half-life of a first order kinetic process is constant and does not depend on the plasma concentration of the drug itself. The disposition of most drugs follows first order kinetics (<strong><a href="#ff7-2">Figure 7.2</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">In contrast, a process with <strong><em>zero-order kinetics</em></strong> is a reaction whose rate is independent of the concentration of the drug undergoing the reaction. A constant amount of the drug is removed in a unit time.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">For a zero-order reaction, a plot of the concentration of any reactant versus time is a straight line with a slope of &#x2212;k. For a first-order reaction, a plot of the natural logarithm of the concentration of a reactant versus time is a straight line with a slope of &#x2212;k. For a second-order reaction, a plot of the inverse of the concentration of a reactant versus time is a straight line with a slope of k.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Nonlinear kinetics</em></strong> describes a drug clearance process in which at low concentrations a drug is cleared by first order kinetics, but at high concentrations by zero order kinetics (eg, phenytoin or ethanol). This happens when the enzyme system involved becomes saturated<sup><a href="ch007-sec03.xhtml#bib6">6</a></sup> by the amount of drug present. These processes are also known as Michaelis-Menten processes.</p>
<p class="indent">Consequently, there are three factors that at any given time control the current plasma concentration of the drug: the dose of the drug administered intravenously, the distribution in and out of body tissues (diffusion), and the elimination of effective drug (clearance).</p>
<a id="page136"></a>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen91">D. Mathematical Concepts in Pharmacokinetics</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>1. Volume of Distribution</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">In compartmental pharmacokinetic models, drugs are imagined to be distributed into one or more &#x201C;boxes,&#x201D; or compartments. These compartments cannot be equated directly with specific tissues, but instead represent the collective activity of organs with similar rates of equilibration.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The volume of distribution is the ratio of the total amount of drug present in the body to plasma concentration.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The volume of distribution, <em>V</em><sub>d</sub>, relates the total amount of drug present to the concentration observed in the central compartment, such that <em>V</em><sub>d</sub> equals the amount of drug administered divided by the initial drug concentration in plasma. This is an <strong><em>apparent</em></strong> volume of distribution and has no relationship with the actual volume of any tissue. Indeed, the mathematical value of <em>V</em><sub>d</sub> can be larger than the actual physical volume of the patient. <em>V</em><sub>d</sub> is large for lipophilic drugs because of their extensive tissue uptake, and low and closer to plasma volume for hydrophilic drugs.</p>
<p class="indent">When injected intravenously (ie, bioavailability being 100%), the concentration of drug in plasma is the amount of the drug injected (mg) divided by the plasma volume (mL). If all the drug initially stays in plasma, the volume of distribution of the injected drug is equal to the plasma volume. However, drugs with a high <em>V</em><sub>d</sub> enter multiple extravascular compartments, and therefore, a higher dose of the drug is required to achieve a given plasma concentration (eg, propofol). Conversely, a drug which tends to stay in the intravascular compartment will have a low <em>V</em><sub>d</sub> (eg, neuromuscular blockers), and so a lower dose is adequate to achieve a given plasma concentration.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Drug elimination is dependent on volume of distribution of the drug and its clearance.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">2. Effects of Hepatic or Renal Disease on Pharmacokinetic Parameters</h6>
<p class="nonindent">In order to understand the effect of hepatic and renal disease on drug disposition, it is important to understand the concept of systemic clearance (<em>CL</em><sub>SYS</sub>) defined as:</p>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/136-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="nonindent">where <em>CL</em><sub>R</sub> is renal clearance and <em>CL</em><sub>NR</sub> is nonrenal clearance.</p>
<a id="page137"></a>
<p class="indent">Renal clearance is given by <em>CL</em><sub>R</sub> = (U.V/P), where U is the concentration of the drug in urine, P is the free plasma concentration of the drug, and V is the urine flow rate. Hepatic clearance <em>CL</em><sub>H</sub>, which is the primary contributor to nonrenal clearance, is given by Rowland equation, as above.</p>
<p class="indent">In patients with hepatic disease, the elimination half-life of drugs metabolized or excreted by the liver is often increased because of decreased clearance and possibly increased volume of distribution caused by ascites and altered protein binding.<sup><a href="ch007-sec03.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup> Drug concentration at steady-state is inversely proportional to elimination clearance. Therefore, when hepatic drug clearance is reduced, repeated bolus dosing or continuous infusion of such drugs as benzodiazepines, opioids, and barbiturates may result in excessive accumulation of these drug and hence excessive and prolonged pharmacologic effects.<sup><a href="ch007-sec03.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup> However, recovery from small doses of drugs such as thiopental and fentanyl occurs largely as a result of redistribution, and so recovery from conservative doses will be only minimally affected by reductions in elimination clearance.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">In hepatic disease states, elimination of drug may be prolonged both due to increased volume of distribution and decreased hepatic clearance.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen92">E. Physiologic Versus Compartmental Models</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Perfusion-based physiologic pharmacokinetic models are realistic models of drug pharmacokinetics. Individual organ blood flow and metabolic rates are modeled in order to understand the disposition of drugs in these organs, thus helping to understand the effect of various physiologic and pathologic states on drug distribution and elimination.<sup><a href="ch007-sec03.xhtml#bib9">9</a></sup> Establishing these models requires the measurement of drug concentrations in many different tissues, which is technically challenging, invasive, and time consuming. Therefore, compartmental models, which are both mathematically and practically simpler, were developed.</p>
<p class="indent">In <strong><em>compartmental pharmacokinetics</em></strong><em>,</em> the body is assumed to be a series of simple communicating compartments, arranged either in series or in parallel. Each compartment comprises organs with similar blood flow. It is assumed that the drug under consideration gets completely mixed in each compartment. The rate of movement between compartments is assumed to follow first-order kinetics and to be dependent only on passive movement in response to concentration gradients between the compartments. Rate constants are used to describe the rates of equilibration between these various compartments, but these can also be converted in half-life form.</p>
<p class="indent">A single compartment model is the simplest of these compartmental pharmacokinetic models. The administered drug is assumed to completely mix with the single compartment, that is plasma. The concentration of the drug in various pertinent tissues is assumed to correspond directly to the plasma drug concentration. So as the concentration of the drug increases in the plasma, the modeled concentration in various tissues increases similarly (see <strong><a href="#ff7-2">Figure 7.2</a></strong>). This single compartment model is too rudimentary for most anesthetic drugs, and so multicompartmental models are employed.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen93">F. Multicompartmental Models</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Many drugs exhibit three distinct pharmacokinetic phases after intravenous administration. These phases can be satisfactorily modeled with the three-compartment model.<sup><a href="ch007-sec03.xhtml#bib10">10</a></sup></p>

<p class="indent">Each of these three phases has its own half-life or rate constant. They are distribution half-life (&#x03B1;), elimination half-life (&#x03B2;), and terminal half-life (&#x03B3;).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><a href="#ff7-3">Figure 7.3</a></strong> shows the standard representation of a multicompartment model. Drug transfer between the central compartment and the more rapidly equilibrating (&#x201C;fast&#x201D; or &#x201C;shallow&#x201D;) peripheral compartment is characterized by the first-order rate constants <em>k</em><sub>12</sub> and <em>k</em><sub>21</sub>.</p>
<p class="indent">Transfer in and out of the more slowly equilibrating (&#x201C;slow&#x201D; or &#x201C;deep&#x201D;) compartment is characterized by the rate constants <em>k</em><sub>13</sub> and <em>k</em><sub>31</sub>. In this model, there are three compartmental volumes: <em>V</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>V</em><sub>2</sub>, and <em>V</em><sub>3</sub>, whose sum equals <em>V</em><sub>ss</sub>; and three clearances: the rapid intercompartmental clearance, the slow intercompartmental clearance, and elimination clearance. <em>k</em><sub>12</sub>, <em>k</em><sub>21</sub>, <em>k</em><sub>13</sub>, <em>k</em><sub>31</sub>, and <em>k</em><sub>10</sub> represent the first-order fractional rate constants for distribution, redistribution, and elimination. Equations exist to convert back and forth between these multicompartmental model <em>k</em> rate constants (known as micro-constants) and the experimentally observable macroscopic rate constants &#x03B1;, &#x03B2;, and &#x03B3; described above.</p>
