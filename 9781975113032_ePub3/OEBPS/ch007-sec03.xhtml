<h4 class="h4" id="sec46">III. Anesthetic Drug Interactions</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The perioperative period is characterized by the administration of varying doses of multiple drugs to induce, maintain, and antagonize anesthetics along with antibiotics, antiepileptics, and each patient&#x2019;s preoperative medications. So there exists the potential for multiple drug interactions, some of which are part of the anesthetic plan (ie, coadministration of an opioid with a volatile anesthetic to decrease the minimum alveolar concentration), and others which are inadvertent consequences of the polypharmacy of the perioperative period.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">These drugs have a narrow therapeutic index: aminoglycosides, cyclosporine, carbamazepine, digoxin, digitoxin, flecainide, lithium, phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampicin, theophylline, and warfarin.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Drug interactions<sup><a href="#bib12">12</a></sup> may occur as either in vitro or in vivo processes. In vitro interactions are due to physical or chemical incompatibility. For example, ceftriaxone should not be reconstituted or mixed with lactated ringer&#x2019;s solution as it tends to precipitate in calcium-containing solutions.</p>
<p class="indent">In vivo interactions are due to induced changes in drug pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. For example, one drug may interact pharmacokinetically with another by causing alterations in its absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination. Pharmacodynamic interactions result from the action of multiple drugs on at the same receptors or physiological system.</p>
<a id="page143"></a>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen97">A. Pharmacokinetic Interactions</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>1. Absorption</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">With the increasing use of preoperative oral medications to attenuate cardiovascular risk (eg, &#x03B2;-receptor antagonists) or decrease opioid requirements after surgery (eg, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, gabapentinoids, sustained release opioids, etc.), anesthesiologists can no longer ignore drugs that alter absorption. For example, grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A4 in jejunal cytochrome P450 enzyme activity and increases the absorption of nonmetabolized drugs such as statins, resulting in higher than expected systemic drug concentrations. Conversely, fexofenadine may block the transporters in the intestinal epithelium and decrease drug absorption. Drugs that alter the gastric pH (eg, ranitidine) or alter gastric emptying and intestinal transit time (eg, metoclopramide) can also alter drug dissolution and drug absorption.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Cytochrome P450 in both the intestines and liver is vulnerable to inducement and inhibition by drugs.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">2. Distribution</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Drug displacement from protein binding sites by competing drugs increases the unbound concentration of a drug and potentially produces exposure to supratherapeutic concentrations and potential toxicity. This is not generally clinically important for anesthetic drugs because (1) for the most part, anesthetic drugs have a tremendous number of unoccupied binding sites and (2) the hepatic metabolism of most anesthetic drugs is flow limited rather than limited by enzymatic capacity. The liver will therefore rapidly normalize the excess free concentration to predisplacement concentrations.</p>
<p class="indent">The more common mechanism by which drug-drug interactions affect the distribution of anesthetic drugs is by changing cardiac output and hence the distribution of cardiac output.<sup><a href="#bib13">13</a></sup> These alterations in the tissue distribution of a drug will change the amount of drug delivered to the effect site. Volatile anesthetics and propofol can alter the distribution of regional blood flow and therefore alter the plasma drug concentration profile.</p>
<h6 class="h6">3. Metabolism</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Many commonly used drugs induce (or inhibit) cytochrome P450 isozymes, which increase (or decrease) hepatic drug metabolism and consequently decrease (or increase) drug exposure. Antiepileptics may increase drug metabolism by the induction of cytochrome P450 3A4. Fortunately, it is relatively easy to increase the dose or dosing frequency of affected drugs to titrate to this effect. It may be more difficult to avoid a drug overdose when there is a decrease in drug metabolism. For example, with the concomitant administration of protease inhibitors that inhibit opioid metabolism, it is necessary to start with lower doses and then slowly increase the dose or dosing frequency to avoid prolonged exposure to supratherapeutic concentrations and toxicity. An additional therapeutic challenge is when the conversion of a prodrug to its active drug is inhibited by another drug. Because of the variability of the amount of CYP 2D6 inhibition by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, it may be easier to avoid opioids that require CYP 2D6 conversion (ie, codeine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone) rather than attempt to predict adequate analgesia in patients taking these drugs.<sup><a href="#bib14">14</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen98">B. Pharmacodynamic Interactions</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The interaction between drugs may be additive, synergistic, or antagonistic. When additive, the effect of the drug combination<a id="page144"></a> is equal to the sum of their individual effects. When synergistic, the effect of the drug combination is greater than the sum of their individual effects. When antagonistic (or subadditive), the effect of the combination is less than the sum of the individual drug effects. The easiest pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions to understand are the methods anesthesiologists use routinely and intentionally to antagonize the clinical effects of opioids and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. The opioid antagonist naloxone is a direct antagonist of the &#x03BC;-opioid receptor. It displaces the opioid from the &#x03BC;-opioid receptor and reverses opioid-induced ventilatory depression and decreases the pain threshold. This antagonism is described as &#x201C;competitive,&#x201D; that is, if there more opioid molecules in comparison to naloxone molecules, the later are displaced by the opioid molecules. Hence when naloxone is given to reverse opioid induced ventilatory depression, repeat dosing or an infusion may be required in order to maintain the clinical effect of the naloxone. When given in the absence of an opioid, naloxone binds to the &#x03BC;-opioid receptor but does not activate it.</p>
<p class="indent">In contrast, the cholinesterase inhibitors (eg, neostigmine) increase the amount of acetylcholine available at the neuromuscular junction. Therefore, they are indirect antagonists of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular junction blocking agents.</p>
<h6 class="h6">1. Isobolograms</h6>
<p class="nonindent">One method of quantify drug-drug interactions is Loewe isobologram. A curve is generated from the dose-response data of the individual drugs. An isobole curve defines the different dose combinations that yield the same effect. The isobole allows for a comparison with actual combination effects, making it possible to determine whether the interaction is synergistic, additive or antagonistic (subadditive) as depicted in <strong><a href="#ff7-6">Figure 7.6</a></strong>. The isobole is linear when the two drugs being studied have a constant potency ratio and curved when the potency ratio is variable.<sup><a href="#bib15">15</a></sup></p>

Wolters Kluwer; 2018:241-275, Figure 11.27.)</figcaption></figure></div>
<a id="page145"></a>
<h6 class="h6">2. Response Surface Models</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Although it is possible to produce the clinical state of general anesthesia solely with the administration of high-effect site concentrations of a volatile anesthetic or an IV anesthetic, the unintended consequences of these include a prolonged time for emergence and undesired hemodynamic side effects (hypotension due to myocardial depression, and arterial and venous dilation). The combination of an opioid and a hypnotic is synergistic and produces a clinical anesthetic state while enabling faster emergence. Analysis of the combinations of an opioid and a hypnotic that produce the same clinical anesthetic state generates a three-dimensional surface that, when projected onto the concentration-effect plane, produces a family of concentration-response curves. These mathematical models are termed <strong><em>response surface models</em></strong>. They include effect-site concentrations for each drug and the probability estimate of the overall effect. These models characterize the entire dose-response relation between combinations of anesthetic drugs and are mathematically consistent with the concentration-response curves of individual drugs (<strong><a href="#ff7-7">Figure 7.7</a></strong>).<sup><a href="#bib16">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">These models have been adapted to enable real-time clinical display. With manual entry of patient demographics and the drugs administered, combined with automated data collection from the anesthesia machine (such as end tidal of volatile anesthetic and infusion pump information), such display devices provide predictions of drug concentrations and estimated combined drug effects. Automatic control of drug infusions in order to attain a desired effect has led to the concept of target-controlled infusions (TCIs).</p>

The projection of the response surface onto the 50% probability horizontal plane results in the 50% effect isobole while the projection of the response surface onto the 2.5&#x00A0;ng/mL remifentanil effect site concentration vertical plane results in the sevoflurane concentration-response curve under 2.5&#x00A0;ng/mL of remifentanil.

<a id="page146"></a>
<p class="indent">Some devices will also display context-sensitive half time (CSHT), either graphically or numerically. CSHT is the predicted time that it will take for a given drug plasma concentration to fall by 50% after stopping the infusion. &#x201C;Context&#x201D; refers here to the dosage and duration of the infusion of the drug up to the current time. CSHT gives an estimate of the duration of remaining drug effect as a single combined function of the PKPD of the drug and the amount given so far. As the duration of an infusion increases, the CSHT increases and will eventually asymptotically approach a maximum half-time at steady state. However, some limitations of CSHT are as follows:</p>
<ul class="bblue"><li><span>CSHT is not a fixed kinetic parameter and cannot easily be extrapolated backward or forward to lesser or greater drug concentrations.</span></li>
<li><span>For a given drug, the most relevant concentration decrease may not be 50% and the times for different percentage decreases in plasma concentration are not linear.</span></li>
<li><span>Effect site concentration is more important than plasma concentration.</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen99">C. Unintended Toxicity</h5>
<p class="nonindent">While most outpatient medications have very little pharmacodynamic interaction with common perioperative medications, a few significant exceptions exist. Antidepressants that inhibit the CNS monoamine oxidase (to inhibit the degradation of serotonin) or that decrease the reuptake of serotonin can result in toxic serotonin CNS concentrations if they are combined with other monoamine oxidase inhibitors (eg, methylene blue) or other serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, methadone, meperidine, and tramadol). Unfortunately, washout of these antidepressants can take over 4&#x00A0;weeks and cause worsening pain or depression. When methylene blue administration is required, it is recommended that an interacting antidepressant not be restarted for at least 24 hours afterward.<sup><a href="#bib17">17</a></sup></p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The increased use of medications that modulate the serotonergic pathways of the central nervous system can potentially produce serotonin syndrome (confusion, hyperactivity, memory problems, muscle twitching, excessive sweating, shivering, or fever).</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">There is widespread use of herbal medicines among the presurgical population.<sup><a href="#bib18">18</a></sup> Of the herbal medications that clinicians are likely to encounter, echinacea, ephedra, garlic, ginkgo, ginseng, kava, St John&#x2019;s wort, and valerian potentially pose the greatest impact to the care of patients undergoing surgery.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Garlic can increase the risk of bleeding when taken along with other antiplatelet agents and must be stopped 7&#x00A0;days before surgery.</p>
