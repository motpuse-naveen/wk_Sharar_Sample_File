<h4 class="h4" id="sec136">III. Physiology of Fluid Management</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The kidneys play several key roles in maintaining homeostasis in the human body. In addition to maintaining normal acid-base status, the kidneys must regulate total body water and solute because daily intake of each is variable. Improper regulation can result in too little body water (cellular dehydration) or too much body water (tissue edema). Similar regulation occurs when patients<a id="page486"></a> have no oral intake and instead are receiving intravenous fluid (ie, water with dissolved solute). A thorough knowledge of how administered fluids are distributed among the various body compartments, as well as their individual components, is essential. Intravenous fluid should be considered like any other pharmaceutics insofar as there are specific indications and clinical contexts that determine proper fluid therapy. For example, patients residing in the intensive care unit or presenting to the operating room may have low extracellular fluid volume, cellular dehydration, or both as a result of major trauma, hemorrhage, prolonged fasting or malnutrition, or protracted vomiting or diarrhea. Both the choice of fluid composition and its infusion rate are dictated accordingly, in this case, most likely high-volume resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid. The anesthesiologist must take into account such clinical contexts and pathophysiologies when tailoring fluid management for a given patient.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Fluid Compartments</strong></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen355">A. Body Fluid Compartments</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Total body water (TBW)</em></strong> is estimated to comprise 60% and 50% of the lean body mass of adult males and females, respectively. TBW is distributed throughout various body compartments with roughly 66% making up the <strong><em>intracellular fluid (ICF)</em></strong> and 33% making up the <strong><em>extracellular fluid (ECF)</em></strong>. ECF is further divided into interstitial fluid and plasma, which account for approximately 24% and 8% of the TBW, respectively (<strong><a href="#ff23-2">Figure 23.2</a></strong>). Thus, for an adult male weighing 70&#x00A0;kg, the TBW is estimated to be 42&#x00A0;L. Of this amount, only 3.5&#x00A0;L is plasma, with the remainder of the circulating blood volume being red blood cells (see also <a href="ch003.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen356">B. Regulation of Extracellular Fluid Volume</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The control of ECF concentration and volume is important for cellular function, transfer of molecules between ICF and ECF, and maintenance of circulating blood volume. Normal serum osmolarity is 285 to 295 mOsm/L and is calculated from measured concentrations of sodium, glucose, and urea (blood urea nitrogen [BUN]) as follows:</p>
<p class="u_equation"><img src="images/486-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<div class="figureu5" id="ff23-2"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff23-2.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="ucaption"><span class="u_fignum">Figure&#160;23.2</span> The approximate distribution of total body water (TBW) in the various body compartments is shown for a 70-kg adult man. ECF, extracellular fluid; ICF, intracellular fluid; ISF, interstitial fluid.</figcaption></figure></div>
<a id="page487"></a>
<p class="indent">It should be noted, however, that a difference exists between <strong><em>osmolarity</em></strong> (the concentration of particles dissolved per unit of serum volume) and <strong><em>tonicity</em></strong> (the effective osmolarity that can exert an osmotic force across a membrane). Tonic molecules (eg, Na<strong><sup>+</sup></strong>) are considered &#x201C;effective osmoles&#x201D; because they do not move freely across a membrane. They are able to cause water movement down a concentration gradient. In contrast, because urea freely diffuses across biologic membranes and distributes itself throughout the TBW, it is not <strong><em>tonic.</em></strong> Thus, under conditions of relative normoglycemia, the major contributor to serum osmolarity and tonicity is the Na<strong><sup>+</sup></strong> concentration.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Osmolarity is the number of solute particles per liter of solution, whereas osmolality is the number of particles per kilogram of solvent. Both terms describe the solute concentration of a solution, and due to the negligible difference in their values, are often used interchangeably.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The concentration and volume of the ECF are maintained by both thirst and the hormonal actions of the <strong><em>renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)</em></strong> and <strong><em>antidiuretic hormone (ADH)</em></strong> on the kidneys, which alter the amount of Na<strong><sup>+</sup></strong> and water excreted in urine. ADH is released (ie, nontonic release) from the posterior pituitary in response to small changes (2%-3%) in serum tonicity or &#x003E;10% decreases in effective circulating volume. The RAAS is activated by hypotension, the sympathetic nervous system, and decreased Na<strong><sup>+</sup></strong> delivery to the kidneys (<strong><a href="#ff23-3">Figure 23.3</a></strong>). The end result is increased thirst (increased water intake), increased renal retention of Na<strong><sup>+</sup></strong> <a id="page488"></a>and water, and vasoconstriction, all of which act to maintain effective circulating volume and perfusion of vital organs.</p>
<div class="figureu5" id="ff23-3"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff23-3.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="ucaption"><span class="u_fignum">Figure&#160;23.3</span> Neurohormonal regulation of extracellular volume, arterial blood pressure, and sodium/water balance is modulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The RAAS is activated by hypotension, decreased sodium intake, or sympathetic nervous system activity, resulting in the release of renin from the kidneys, leading to increased angiotensin II. Angiotensin II promotes vasoconstriction, thirst, aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex, and increased renal sodium and water reabsorption. The HPA axis secretes antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in response to increased plasma osmolarity, decreased extracellular fluid (ECF), or decreased plasma angiotensin and leads to increased renal free water absorption in the kidneys and further vasoconstriction. ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme.</figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen357">C. Distribution of Infused Fluids</h5>
<p class="nonindent">There are two types of fluids commonly used for intravenous administration that are categorized by their ability to diffuse through a semipermeable membrane: <strong><em>crystalloids</em></strong> and <strong><em>colloids</em></strong>. Crystalloids readily diffuse across a semipermeable membrane, whereas colloids do not. Crystalloids are generally a base of sterile water in which various electrolytes are dissolved. They may be further categorized by their tonicity relative to serum: <strong><em>hypotonic</em></strong>, <strong><em>isotonic</em></strong>, and <strong><em>hypertonic</em></strong> solutions. The composition of several commonly used intravenous solutions is presented in <strong><a href="#tt23-7">Table 23.7</a></strong>.</p>
<p class="indent">Renal excretion notwithstanding, the tonicity of a given crystalloid will determine across which body compartments the solution will initially distribute. Hypotonic and isotonic solutions generally equilibrate across TBW and ECF, respectively. An estimation of the initial volume distribution following the rapid infusion of 1000&#x00A0;mL of various crystalloids and colloids is presented in <strong><a href="#tt23-8">Table 23.8</a></strong>.</p>
<p class="indent">Traditional teaching is that colloids are unable to move across an intact endothelial barrier and therefore remain entirely within the plasma. Additionally, the maintenance of normal plasma colloid oncotic pressure allows for maximal reabsorption of interstitial fluid back into the vascular tree on the venular side of the microcirculation (see <a href="ch003.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>). Consequently, it has long been taught that three or four times as much crystalloid must be administered as colloid to achieve the same plasma volume expansion. However, this is not supported by current evidence. Most studies report a volume equivalence of colloid to isotonic crystalloid less than two to one (see the section that follows).</p>
