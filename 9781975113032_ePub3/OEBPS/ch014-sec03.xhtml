<h4 class="h4" id="sec86">III. Anesthesia Breathing Systems</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Thus far, this chapter has characterized the confluence of oxygen/air/nitrous oxide and volatile anesthetics on the common fresh gas flow outlet. This section will explain what happens to this fresh gas as it enters the anesthesia breathing system. The <strong><em>circle system</em></strong> is the most commonly used design. In this system, a breathing bag (or ventilator bellows) contracts and delivers a tidal<a id="page296"></a> volume of gas into a patient&#x2019;s lungs. The patient exhales back into the breathing bag (or ventilator). This to-and-fro reciprocal exchange of gas between the breathing bag/ventilator and the patient&#x2019;s lungs allows for <strong><em>rebreathing</em></strong> of exhaled gases (<strong><a href="#ff14-8">Figure 14.8</a></strong>). The components of this system are as follows. First, just past the point where the fresh gas flow enters the circle system exists the <strong><em>one-way inspiratory valve</em></strong>. This allows for both the delivered tidal volume and fresh gas flow to travel only in the antegrade direction to the patient through a section of corrugated tubing known as the <strong><em>inspiratory limb</em></strong>. The inspiratory limb attaches to a <strong><em>Y-piece</em></strong> connector that, in turn, is connected to the patient via a mask, laryngeal mask, or endotracheal tube.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff14-7"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff14-7.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="caption"><span class="fignum">Figure&#160;14.7</span> Simplified schematic of the Tec 6 desflurane vaporizer.

<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">It is routine to administer 3 to 5&#x00A0;L/min of oxygen at the beginning of an anesthetic. This far exceeds the oxygen consumed by the patient. The waste gas must be vented. During manual ventilation, the APL (or &#x201C;pop-off&#x201D; valve) opens when pressure in the circle system exceeds the set limit. During mechanical ventilation, waste gas is vented during the expiratory phase at zero (or very low) pressure.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Second, during expiration, the exhaled tidal volume courses out through the Y-piece and through the <strong><em>expiratory limb</em></strong> of corrugated tubing past the <strong><em>expiratory one-way valve</em></strong>. Again, this valve allows for unidirectional flow of expired gases. Between the inspiratory and expiratory valves, flow is unidirectional, as seen in <strong><a href="#ff14-8">Figure 14.8</a></strong>.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, the expired tidal volume may enter two different paths. During manual or spontaneous ventilation, some of the expired volume will pass through the <strong><em>adjustable pressure-limiting (APL) valve</em></strong> (commonly referred to as the pop-off valve) and enter the scavenging system or instead go on to reinflate the breathing bag. What fraction of the tidal volume enters scavenging versus reinflates the breathing bag is largely determined by how open or closed the APL valve position might be and the fresh gas flow rate entering the system. Additionally, a positive pressure is needed to exit through the APL valve. Hence, this typically only happens during manual, positive-pressure inspiration or at end exhalation when the breathing bag is full. Analogously,<a id="page297"></a> during mechanical ventilation, expired gases will act to reinflate the ventilator bellows. The ventilator contains its own pressure-relief valve, which allows expired gases to enter the scavenging system (discussed later).</p>

<p class="indent">Fourth, upon the next inspiratory cycle, another tidal volume enters the inspiratory limb. Prior to doing so, however, this volume of gas must first pass through a canister filled with absorbent material aimed at neutralizing any carbon dioxide. Recall that this is a <strong><em>circle</em></strong> system that allows for <strong><em>rebreathing.</em></strong> Were it not for the presence of this carbon dioxide absorbent, the patient would ultimately sustain increasing carbon dioxide tension and hypercapnia. The circle system is intrinsically complex. Disadvantages naturally arise from multiple connections and constituent components that may malfunction or be misconnected. Adding to the intricacy is the fact that some components are disposable and others are permanent. However, this design is a popular one owing to its allowance for very low fresh gas flows and conservation of anesthetic gases, heat, and humidity.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a>-<a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> Several interesting considerations related to the use of the circle breathing system are illustrated in the section that follows.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Generic Circle System</strong></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen206">A. Impact of Fresh Gas Flow</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Proper function of the circle system depends significantly on the fresh gas flow rate being delivered from the common gas outlet. If a very high flow<a id="page298"></a> (eg, &#x003E;10&#x00A0;L/min) enters the circle system and the patient is being mechanically ventilated, there is a risk of trauma to the lungs. This is because the ventilator&#x2019;s automatic pressure relief valve is completely closed during the inspiratory phase,<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup> and the simultaneous inflow of fresh gas during this short interval can cause a dangerously high increase in the inspiratory pressure.</p>
<p class="indent">Additionally, if the fresh gas flow is high (eg, 10&#x00A0;L/min), virtually <strong><em>all</em></strong> of the expired tidal volume will escape through the scavenging system, creating a <strong><em>non-rebreathing circuit</em></strong>. This phenomenon can be effectively used at the conclusion of surgery to allow patients to emerge from inhalational anesthesia because there is no rebreathing of exhaled anesthetic gases.</p>
<p class="indent">Conversely, if the fresh gas flow into the circle system is too low, this can be problematic. For example, a patient&#x2019;s normal oxygen consumption is approximately 300&#x00A0;mL/min, and this can increase significantly if the patient is hypermetabolic (eg, fever). If less than the patient&#x2019;s required volume of oxygen is provided, the rebreathing bag (or ventilator bellows) will collapse, and the patient will be unable to breathe. Also, if it is desired to rapidly change the concentration of delivered anesthetic, this will take considerable time at a low flow rate. In addition, gas analyzers attached to the circle system can draw off up to 150&#x00A0;mL/min. Finally, some potentially harmful metabolites of volatile anesthetics are exhaled. Use of extremely low fresh gas flow rates will allow these products to accumulate in the circle system. Under most circumstances when a circle system is in use, there are only rare indications for use of a total fresh gas flow rate of &#x003C;1&#x00A0;L/min.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen207">B. Unidirectional Valves</h5>
<p class="nonindent">As mentioned earlier, the presence of one-way valves ensures that a delivered tidal volume enters a patient&#x2019;s lungs during inspiration and exits the system during expiration. Incompetent seating of either of these valves results in <strong><em>bidirectional</em></strong> flow, which allows expired gases, particularly carbon dioxide, to contaminate the inspiratory gas. This carbon dioxide oscillates between the inspiratory and expiratory limb and is therefore immune to the presence of the carbon dioxide absorbent.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen208">C. Adjustable Pressure-Limiting Valve</h5>
<p class="nonindent">During manual (bag) ventilation, the APL valve is carefully adjusted. It is partially closed off just enough to allow a sufficient tension in the breathing bag to develop. This permits the user to squeeze the bag and reliably insufflate the patient&#x2019;s lungs with an appropriate tidal volume. With practice, one quickly appreciates that if the APL valve is too constricted, pressure will build in the system as evidenced by high pulmonary pressures and a swelling breathing bag. Conversely, an APL valve left completely open will not enable any tension in the circuit to occur. Therefore, the anesthesiologist will not be able to manually deliver a tidal volume to the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">When a patient is breathing spontaneously through the circle system, the breathing bag does not require any manual compression by the anesthesiologist. Therefore, the APL valve may remain in the open position to discourage any accumulation of gas and pressure within the system. In some circumstances, such as with a patient who is developing atelectasis, the APL can be adjusted to enable a small amount of continuous positive pressure to develop in the system and expand collapsed alveoli.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen209">D. The Breathing Bag</h5>
<p class="nonindent">During the anesthetic management of adult patients, a 3-L breathing bag is typically affixed to the circle system. Smaller volume bags are available for<a id="page299"></a> pediatric and neonatal use. Breathing bags are considered high-volume, low-pressure systems. Beyond 3&#x00A0;L, the pressure within a breathing bag will rise steeply with increasing volume. However, these bags are designed so that their compliance will actually change at extremes of capacity. This limits the rise in internal pressure that can be attained.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a>,<a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen210">E. Carbon Dioxide Absorbents</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Carbon dioxide absorbents consist of fine, solid-phase granules that participate in an acid-base reaction with carbon dioxide. Smaller-sized granules result in greater absorptive capacity; however, this also creates increased resistance to gas flow through the absorbent. The primary purpose of these absorbents is to ultimately convert carbon dioxide into an inert salt, calcium carbonate. Classically, older absorbents such as soda lime consisted of water, calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, and a more potent base, sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The reaction between soda lime and carbon dioxide proceeded as follows:</p>
<ol class="u_num2">
<li><span>CO<sub>2</sub>&#x00A0;+&#x00A0;H<sub>2</sub>O &#x2192; H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (carbonic acid)</span></li>
<li><span>H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 2NaOH &#x2192; Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (sodium carbonate)&#x00A0;+&#x00A0;2H<sub>2</sub>O</span></li>
<li><span>Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>&#x00A0;+&#x00A0;Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> &#x2192; 2NaOH&#x00A0;+&#x00A0;CaCO<sub>3</sub> (calcium carbonate)</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Of note, soda lime also contained small amounts of another reactive base, potassium hydroxide (KOH), which also participated in the above reaction in a manner entirely analogous to sodium hydroxide. Although carbon dioxide absorbents are highly effective at mitigating the risks of hypercapnia in the circle system, they impose their own brand of hazards. Strong bases such as NaOH and KOH are highly reactive, so much so that they react not only with carbon dioxide but also with the volatile anesthetics that must pass through the absorbent. Specifically, the use of sevoflurane with older absorbents has been noted to generate an intense amount of thermal energy, to the point of inciting absorbent canister fires. By-products of anesthetic degradation have also been problematic. Sevoflurane may react with carbon dioxide absorbents to form Compound A, a vinyl ether that could theoretically be nephrotoxic. Desflurane, more than any other anesthetic, is also notable for its degradation to carbon monoxide in the presence of desiccated absorbent. All of these untoward effects of anesthetic reactions with carbon dioxide absorbents are augmented when older, dry absorbent is used for prolonged periods under low fresh gas flow conditions.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a>-<a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> Modern carbon dioxide absorbents (ie, Amsorb, Armstrong Medical, Coleraine, Northern Ireland; Dr&#x00E4;gersorb, Dr&#x00E4;ger, East Tamaki, New Zealand) have addressed the potential toxicities listed above by completely eliminating the presence of highly reactive bases such as sodium hydroxide. They consist solely of calcium hydroxide and water.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup> This results in a somewhat diminished capacity to absorb carbon dioxide. Alternatively, absorbents with a new chemical composition using lithium (Litholyme, Allied Health Care Products, St Louis, Missouri) are characterized by different chemical reactions with carbon dioxide and greater absorbent capacity.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Evidence of exhausted carbon dioxide absorbent includes a change to violet color, attempts by the patient to hyperventilate, and elevated inspired carbon dioxide with capnography.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Continued use of absorbent will eventually extinguish its capacity to absorb any further carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide absorbents are typically impregnated with an indicator dye that responds to decreasing pH when the absorbent is exhausted. Ethyl violet is most commonly used. This dye imparts a violet hue to the absorbent when it is exhausted.</p>
<a id="page300"></a>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen211">F. End-Tidal Gas Monitoring, Oxygen Analyzer, and Spirometry</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Measurements of respiratory gases and pulmonary volumes are not required components for a functional circle system, but they provide valuable added safety. The <strong><em>oxygen analyzer</em></strong> sits atop the inspiratory one-way valve. This location for the analyzer is particularly suitable as it will gauge the FiO<sub>2</sub> immediately downstream of the fresh gas flow inlet. The most commonly used analyzers use galvanic cell analysis to measure oxygen. These analyzers measure the current produced as oxygen diffuses across a membrane within, ultimately being reduced to hydroxide at the anode of an electrical circuit. The amount of current produced is proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen present.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Whereas inspiratory gas analysis focuses on the fraction of inspired oxygen, <strong><em>expiratory gas analysis</em></strong> measures and displays the tensions of carbon dioxide and volatile anesthetics. Most often, a Luer-lock port at the Y-piece connector draws away expired gas at a rate of 50 to 150&#x00A0;mL/min to an independent infrared absorbance analyzer. This device is capable of identifying the presence and concentrations of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and volatile anesthetics.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, the patient&#x2019;s <strong><em>expired tidal volumes</em></strong> are typically measured in the expiratory limb just upstream of the expiratory one-way valve. Spirometers use a rotating vane, ultrasound, or a heated wire to measure gas flow and display the values electronically.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen212">G. Mechanical Ventilators</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Frequently, a mechanical ventilator is employed to ventilate the patient during anesthesia. This can be done to permit the anesthesiologist to have a &#x201C;hands-free&#x201D; method for delivering a reliable volume of ventilation, or it can be a necessity when the patient is paralyzed or has significant lung disease.</p>
<p class="indent">Ventilators associated with the anesthesia workstation often use a dual-circuit, gas-driven design (<strong><a href="#ff14-9">Figure 14.9</a></strong>). A compressible bellows assembly delivers a volume of gas to the patient. These bellows are compressed through the action of a &#x201C;drive&#x201D; gas, which is external to the bellows. Thus, there are <strong><em>two circuits of gas</em></strong>: one for the patient&#x2019;s lungs, the other to drive the bellows. The drive gas may either be compressed air, oxygen, or a mixture of the two. If oxygen is used as the drive gas, then any disruption of the central supply of oxygen to the workstation will not only compromise delivery of carrier gas to the fresh gas outlet but will also render the mechanical ventilator incapable of delivering a tidal volume. Newer anesthesia machines may use a ventilator that incorporates a single-circuit, <strong><em>piston-driven</em></strong> design. In such cases, an electrically powered piston delivers a tidal volume to the patient. This of course means that failure of electrical power will incapacitate the ventilator. The latest design for delivery of controlled tidal volumes has been the inclusion of an electrically driven compressor turbine within the inspiratory limb of the circle system.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a>-<a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Regardless of the mechanism through which the ventilator delivers the proposed tidal volume, there must be a route for the escape of excess gas during expiration. Similar to how the APL valve interfaces with the scavenging system during spontaneous or manual bag ventilation, a dedicated <strong><em>spill valve</em></strong> directs excess expiratory gas through this evacuation route during mechanical ventilation.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Characterizing the settings of a mechanical ventilator requires defining how each breath is <strong><em>cycled</em></strong> and by what measure it is <strong><em>limited.</em></strong> Most often, mechanical ventilation is <strong><em>time cycled</em></strong>, that is, the selected respiratory rate will define how often the ventilator delivers a breath. Very commonly, mechanical ventilation is <strong><em>volume limited</em></strong>, that is, the set tidal volume predicts the maximum volume that will be delivered to the patient. Although defining these two simple parameters should generate a predictable minute ventilation (tidal volume&#x00A0;&#x00D7;&#x00A0;respiratory rate), the true limitation of this strategy may be governed by a variety of other parameters also under the control of the anesthesiologist. In addition to <strong><em>tidal volume</em></strong> and respiratory <strong><em>rate</em></strong>, the user customarily predefines the settings for inspiratory <strong><em>pressure</em></strong> limit, drive gas <strong><em>flow</em></strong> rate, and the <strong><em>inhale-to-exhale ratio</em></strong> prior to initiating controlled mechanical ventilation. An illustrative example follows: a 600-mL tidal volume at a respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min is selected for a healthy patient. The predicted minute ventilation is thus 6&#x00A0;L/min. However, if the inspiratory pressure limit (the peak pulmonary pressure beyond which the ventilator will no longer continue to deliver any further volume) is inadvertently set to a very low threshold, for example, 10&#x00A0;cm&#x00A0;H<sub>2</sub>O, only a small tidal volume will be delivered. In this case, the inspiratory pressure limit serves as the true limitation to minute ventilation.</p>

The bellows physically separates the driving gas circuit from the patient gas circuit. The driving gas circuit is located outside the bellows, and the patient gas circuit is inside the bellows. During inspiratory phase (<strong>A</strong>), the driving gas enters the bellows chamber, causing the pressure within it to increase. This causes the ventilator relief valve to close, preventing anesthetic gas from escaping into the scavenging system, and the bellows to compress, delivering anesthetic gas within the bellows to the patient&#x2019;s lungs. During expiratory phase (<strong>B</strong>), pressure within the bellows chamber and the pilot line decreases to zero, causing the mushroom portion of the ventilator relief valve to open. Gas exhaled by the patient refills the bellows before any scavenging occurs because a weighted ball is incorporated into the base of the ventilator relief valve. Scavenging occurs only during the expiratory phase because the ventilator relief valve is only open during expiration. (Adapted from Andrews JJ. <em>The Circle System.

<p class="indent">Additionally, depending on the surgical procedure and the patient&#x2019;s underlying illnesses, the anesthesiologist may select from a variety of profiles that define how the mechanical breath is delivered. These include volume-controlled ventilation, pressure-controlled ventilation, and pressure-support ventilation with or without the inclusion of positive end-expiratory pressure.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen213">H. Modern Anesthesia Machines</h5>
<p class="nonindent">This chapter has thus far described the characteristics of a conventional model of the anesthesia workstation. Such classic machines of older generations have a consistent architecture; much of the machinery is external and they require a more hands-on approach to checkout and usage. In contrast, more modern workstations rely heavily on sophisticated, computerized processing. These workstations have automated self-checkouts and often employ an ergonomic design that keeps much of the machine anatomy hidden.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">By far, the most important feature that many of these new workstations incorporate is the concept of <strong><em>fresh gas flow decoupling</em></strong>. Recall how tidal ventilation can become augmented when high fresh gas flows are used during mechanical ventilation in conventional anesthesia machines. This occurs because the fresh gas flow is &#x201C;coupled&#x201D; to the circle system during inspiration. Many new workstation designs divorce the fresh gas flow from the circle system during the inspiratory phase and, as a result, the patient only receives the prescribed tidal volume set by the user. A decoupling valve diverts fresh gas flow typically into the breathing bag during the inspiratory phase. Once exhalation commences, fresh gas flow is coupled and the gas within the breathing bag deploys into the circuit, refilling the ventilator bellows. This remarkably different design in the anesthesia workstation virtually eliminates the risk of fresh gas flow&#x2013;induced volutrauma or barotrauma. The major disadvantage to fresh gas decoupled machines is the reliance imposed on the breathing bag as a fresh gas reservoir. Should the breathing bag become partially or fully disconnected, two problems arise. First, anesthetic gas will pollute the operating room. Second, room air will be entrained into the circuit, which will dilute the intended fraction of oxygen and anesthetic desired for the patient.<sup><a href="ch014-sec05.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the fundamental changes in gas delivery described above, modern anesthesia workstations are asked to accomplish far more than merely ventilate a patient&#x2019;s lungs. They are frequently integrated with computing systems to serve as a data processing station. In the current era of healthcare<a id="page303"></a> delivery in the developed world, patient data are almost exclusively tracked and logged in an electronic health record (EHR). In contrast to other fields of medicine, anesthesiology is characterized by the simultaneous acute management of the patient alongside real-time record keeping. As the latter may be construed as a distraction while performing intense cognitive and physical tasks, automated data recording systems have emerged. Anesthesia care providers may now focus primarily on clinically managing a patient, while computer systems automatically populate the EHR with ongoing vital signs, ventilatory parameters, and respiratory gas concentrations. This convenience has its own drawbacks. Each patient monitor must interface with a data hub that then transposes the information to the computing system running the EHR. The entire system is within the domain of an encrypted, hospital-based data network. For this to function properly, it requires the integrity of an enormous amount of hardware and software to be maintained. It is strongly advised that anesthesia providers become proficient in using the EHR and familiarize themselves with the basic hardware connectivity of their workspace. As one can imagine, the dysfunction of any single component of hardware or software that cannot be readily diagnosed and rectified can lead to a tremendous diversion of attention from patient care.</p>
