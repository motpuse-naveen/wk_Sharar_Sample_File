<h4 class="h4" id="sec287">V. Electrosurgery</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The use of electrosurgery in clinical practice was pioneered in 1926 through a collaboration between neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing and physicist William Bovie.<sup><a href="ch044-sec06.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup> Electrosurgery is different from electrocautery. Electrocautery is the process of using electricity (commonly DC current) to generate heat and then applying that heat to tissue to cauterize it. In electrocautery, the electricity is simply a convenient form of energy to convert to heat at the surgical site.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead, electrosurgery makes use of alternating current at very high frequencies, on the order of 300&#x00A0; to 500&#x00A0;kHz, generated by an electrosurgical unit (ESU). These frequencies are sufficiently high that they are close to the radio frequencies (RF) used to transmit medium-wave AM radio. Electrosurgery is therefore sometimes referred to as RF electrosurgery in order to further distinguish it from simple cautery. The power output from an ESU operating in &#x201C;cut&#x201D; mode exceeds the power required simply to burn or desiccate tissue&#x2014;it is sufficient to convert the water within the tissue into vapor, effectively exploding the tissue itself. The use of a fine-pointed surgical electrode produces a region of very high current density around the tip and creates precisely controllable surgical tissue dissection.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">A large dispersive electrode (&#x201C;grounding pad&#x201D;) is not required for bipolar electrosurgical instruments. The current in one electrode is returned to the adjacent electrode and does not pass elsewhere in the body.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">When using electrosurgery, an electrical current has been introduced into the body. Therefore, the path this current travels through the body and to return to the ESU must be in a manner such that no other surgical effects occur outside of the desired region. Many electrosurgical tools have two electrodes, referred to as <strong><em>bipolar instruments</em></strong>&#x2014;the current is introduced to tissue through one electrode at the tip of the instrument, and a second electrode nearby receives the return current. This design is appropriate for instruments such as laparoscopic scissors, in which the two blades of the scissors act as the two electrodes. The current transmitted to or through neighboring anatomical structures is very small.</p>
<p class="indent">Alternatively, an electrosurgical device may consist of only one electrode&#x2014;described as <strong><em>monopolar</em></strong>; these devices require a separate electrical return path from the patient to the ESU.<sup><a href="ch044-sec06.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup> This return path is created by sticking a large electrically conductive pad to a substantial part of the body such as the patient&#x2019;s thigh. This pad is often referred to as a <strong><em>grounding pad</em></strong>, but that description is<a id="page918"></a> unfortunately misleading. The pad does not ground the patient to earth potential because the patient and the electrosurgical device are electrically isolated by an isolated power system. The purpose of the pad is to act as an electrode to receive the electrosurgical current. The current is retrieved over a large tissue area so that the tissue current density is low. Otherwise, the tissue under the pad might be accidently burned. The grounding pad should therefore, more correctly, be called a <strong><em>dispersive electrode</em></strong>. If the dispersive electrode is improperly applied so that it only contacts the patient&#x2019;s skin in a few small locations, the return current will be concentrated at these points, the current density will be high, and accidental burns may result. It is therefore important that the dispersive electrode is applied smoothly and is not wrinkled. Patients should also be strongly encouraged to remove metal jewelry. For example, a metal wedding ring may come to rest against a metal part of the OR table and form an electrically conductive path back to the dispersive electrode. The wedding ring would then effectively act as an unintended return electrode and could create a circumferential burn to the finger. Metal jewelry that cannot be removed can be covered with tape to provide a layer of electrical insulation.</p>
<p class="indent">The frequency of the electrosurgical current is so high that it does not cause depolarization of nerves or muscle fibers. Nerves and muscles possess a property called <strong><em>chronaxy</em></strong>, defined as the shortest duration of electrical impulse necessary to elicit a response. Since the frequency of the AC current produced by an ESU is at several hundred kilohertz, the duration of one oscillation of the electrosurgical current is far shorter than the chronaxy of these tissues. The electrosurgical current can pass through the body without triggering ventricular fibrillation&#x2014;unlike an electrical shock from equivalent mains power supply current at 60&#x00A0;Hz.</p>
<p class="indent">Special care must be taken with patients who have an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD). The AICD continuously monitors the electrical activity of the patient&#x2019;s heart, and it may misinterpret the high-frequency electrical interference from the electrosurgical current as being an episode of ventricular fibrillation requiring a defibrillation shock. Therefore, the AICD must be inhibited from administering this shock during surgery. The AICD can either be reprogrammed pre- and post-surgery, or it can be temporarily inhibited by placing a large magnet on the patient&#x2019;s chest over the AICD insertion site. The AICD detects the presence of this magnetic field, and then the defibrillator action of the AICD is inhibited while the magnet remains in place. Many AICDs emit an audible warning tone that can be heard clearly through the patient&#x2019;s skin when the magnet is placed.</p>
