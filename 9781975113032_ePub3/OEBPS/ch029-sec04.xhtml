<h5 class="h5" id="sen449">A. Middle Ear and Mastoid</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Common procedures include stapedectomy, tympanoplasty, mastoidectomy, and myringotomy. Intraoperative considerations for middle ear and mastoid surgery include preservation of the facial nerve, prevention of brachial plexus or cervical injuries, and management of the potential adverse effects related to nitrous oxide.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Tympanoplasty and Mastoidectomy</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Facial nerve integrity can be monitored and maintained with intraoperative electromyography and avoidance of neuromuscular blocking agents. A preoperative evaluation of cervical spine range of motion is essential to prevent injuries to the brachial plexus and cervical spine. Extreme neck extension or rotation should be avoided during surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">Nitrous oxide can result in pathological pressure changes in the middle ear if the Eustachian tube is not patent. In particular, sudden discontinuation of nitrous oxide, leading to rapid absorption of nitrous oxide, creates negative pressure and may result in changes to middle ear anatomy, rupture of tympanic membrane, disruption of grafts, and PONV.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen450">B. Nasal and Sinus Surgery</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nasal and sinus surgeries can be performed under local anesthesia with sedation or under GA when there is concern regarding arterial damage or <a id="page609"></a>advancing into the intracranial space, the latter being a concern during endoscopic sinus surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">Intraoperative bleeding is minimized with intranasal vasoconstriction, elevation of the head to facilitate venous drainage, and induced mild hypotension.<sup><a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib10">10</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen451">C. Maxillofacial Trauma and Orthognathic Surgery</h5>
<p class="nonindent">High-speed impact trauma, with or without external evidence of injury, is frequently associated with life-threatening injuries. The anesthetic plan must consider the possibility of cervical spine injuries and skull fractures. Cervical spine stabilization prior to tracheal intubation and oral versus nasal intubation (contraindicated in LeFort III fracture) are also important considerations. Orthognathic surgery for reconstruction of facial skeletal malformations is often achieved by performing LeFort or mandibular osteotomies; therefore, understanding the anatomy of these procedures is beneficial.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen452">D. Craniofacial Bone Structure</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Knowledge of basic craniofacial bone structure is important. The facial skeleton comprises three parts: The lower third is the mandible. The middle portion includes the zygomatic arch of the temporal bone, zygomaticomaxillary complex, maxilla, nasal bones, and orbits. Lastly, the superior portion comprises the frontal bone.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen453">E. Temporomandibular Joint Arthroscopy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">This surgery is indicated when there is displacement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) cartilage causing clicking, trismus, fibrosis, or osteoarthritis. Intubation may be oral (if mobility is achieved with GA) or with nasal fiberoptic assistance if the patient is in trismus. Swelling around the surgical site due to irrigation may result in partial or complete airway obstruction.<sup><a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib10">10</a>,<a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib11">11</a></sup> Limitation in joint mobility with TMJ arthropathy and/or infection/abscess typically depends on chronicity. The longer it is present, the less likely it will become mobile with GA. This is important to discuss with the oral surgery team prior to induction of anesthesia.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen454">F. Surgery of the Airway</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>1. Suspension Laryngoscopy and Microlaryngoscopy</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">These techniques provide direct access and visualization of the airway (ie, no tracheal intubation), while protecting the trachea and maintaining ventilation and oxygenation. These procedures require deep anesthetic levels and muscle relaxation. Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is often the most reasonable choice to avoid uncertainties about volatile anesthetic dosing with an &#x201C;open&#x201D; airway. For muscle relaxation, consider rocuronium and reversal with sugammadex. A succinylcholine infusion can be considered for short cases.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Jet ventilation:</em></strong> It provides ventilation without the use of endotracheal intubation for short cases (&#x003C;30 minutes). Lower pressure (30-50 psi) jet ventilation is used to reduce the risk of barotrauma, which is more likely to occur in children, those with chronic pulmonary disease, and the obese. Stimulation of the larynx may trigger arrhythmias, tachycardia, or hypertension. To block a severe sympathetic response due to stimulation of the larynx, one may administer lidocaine (IV or topical), opiates (eg, remifentanil infusion for faster recovery), and/or beta blockers (<strong><a href="#ff29-2">Figure 29.2</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Laser surgery of the airway:</em></strong> It can be used for microsurgery of the upper airway or trachea. Benefits include coagulation of small vessels, reduced tissue inflammation, and better precision. One serious potential complication is airway fire. Usage of fire-resistant, impregnated, or shielded endotracheal tubes, a low F<span class="usmall">IO</span><sub>2</sub>, and avoidance of nitrous oxide are prudent precautions.<sup><a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib11">11</a>,<a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib12">12</a></sup></p>

The surgical view of the laryngoscope positioned in the patient&#x2019;s pharynx and connected to a continuous flow of oxygen through the jet ventilator needle (B).</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<h6 class="h6">2. Bronchoscopy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Bronchoscopy can be flexible or rigid. Flexible bronchoscopy is used to examine the smaller airways. Rigid bronchoscopy is used when there is bleeding of the airway, to perform large airway biopsies, to dilate the airway, or to remove foreign bodies.</p>
<p class="indent">Rigid bronchoscopy is performed under GA to prevent airway injury due to coughing, bucking, or straining. Ventilation is administered through a side port of the rigid bronchoscope. The patient may be awakened while being ventilated via mask, laryngeal mask airway (LMA), or endotracheal intubation. Endotracheal intubation may be needed if the patient has received neuromuscular blocking agents or if the protective airway reflexes are compromised.<sup><a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib10">10</a>,<a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib13">13</a></sup></p>
<h6 class="h6">3. Tracheostomy</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Tracheostomy is indicated when there is severe upper airway obstruction, loss of protective reflexes, or vocal cord paralysis. In conscious patients with respiratory distress, it is important to perform a physical examination and determine if a tracheostomy should be done with the patient awake or under GA.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Tracheostomy</strong></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen455">G. Infection</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Infections of the ear, nose, and throat largely result from by gram-negative bacteria. These may be associated with fever, chills, drooling, and difficulty swallowing and speaking.</p>
<h6 class="h6">1. Peritonsillar/Retropharyngeal Abscess and Ludwig Angina</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Occasionally, the abscess must be decompressed under local anesthesia prior to induction. This decreases airway obstruction and the risk of abscess rupture while placing the endotracheal tube. Difficult intubation due to distorted anatomy or trismus may require awake fiberoptic intubation, mask induction with spontaneous breathing, or tracheostomy (<strong><a href="#ff29-3">Figure 29.3</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">Ludwig angina is a cellulitis of the submandibular region that displaces the tongue upward and obstructs the airway.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen456">H. Neck Dissections and Free Flaps</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with head or neck cancer often have a history of heavy smoking and alcohol use with underlying malnutrition and pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. Preparations for potential difficult intubation must be taken due to associated anatomic abnormalities.</p>
<p class="indent">A free flap is a transfer of cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue from one part of the body to another. The vascular supply is disconnected during the transfer and reconnected microsurgically. Vasopressors may compromise flap viability and should be avoided.</p>
