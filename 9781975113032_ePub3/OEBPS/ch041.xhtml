<p class="nonindent">In 1932, William Osler, perhaps the greatest of contemporary physicians, remarked that &#x201C;errors in judgment must occur in the practice of an art which consists largely of balancing probabilities.&#x201D; The practice of medicine applies as much art as science to the treatment of diverse and unique individuals. The 20th century witnessed a transformation of medicine from a largely humanistic art into a technologically driven enterprise accounting for 1/8th of the US gross domestic product. Anesthesiology and Critical Care are practiced in a highly complex clinical arena where critical decisions are often made in the context of patients presenting with superimposed acute and/or chronic illness. Thus, the clinical context is one of variable physiologic reserve, acute pathophysiology, and interventions often based on relatively sparse data. Thus, despite regular advances in the state of medical knowledge and technology, the risk of complications cannot be completely eliminated.</p>

<p class="dify">The estimated anesthesia-specific mortality risk has steadily declined from approximately 1 in 1000 in the 1940s to 1 in 10,000 in the 1970s to 1 in 100,000 in the 2000s.</p>
