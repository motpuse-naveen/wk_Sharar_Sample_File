<h5 class="h5" id="sen444">A. Anatomy and Physiology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Diseases of the ear in children can be best understood by reviewing the anatomy and physiology of the middle ear and adjacent structures. The eardrum is a thin, well-innervated membrane sitting at the deepest part of the external auditory canal. It borders the middle ear laterally. The middle ear drains into the nasopharynx via the Eustachian tube. During infancy, it drains poorly due to its small cross-sectional area, floppy cartilaginous walls, and the low angle it travels toward the nasopharynx. Additionally, its short length increases the proximity of the middle ear to the mucous and bacteria of the nasopharynx. These factors increase the risk of otitis media, with incidence peaking at 1&#x00A0;year of age. Normal growth of these structures reduces the risk of otitis media up through the age of 7&#x00A0;years, where the incidence plateaus at the same level as that of adults.<sup><a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup></p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen445">B. Myringotomy and Tube Insertion</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Myringotomy with ear tube placement requires general anesthesia (GA) to provide the surgeon with the immobility suitable for work under an operating microscope. The short length and relatively mild stimulation of the procedure permit the use of inhaled anesthetics alone, and so these procedures are often performed without securing either intravenous (IV) access or the airway. Induction using a face mask with a mixture of oxygen, nitrous oxide, and sevoflurane can be followed by maintenance with sevoflurane. Positioning the head with 30&#x00B0; to 45&#x00B0; of axial rotation provides favorable surgical access. Due to a highly innervated tympanic membrane, an adequate depth of anesthesia must be ensured prior to blade insertion to prevent patient movement and laryngospasm. Rectal acetaminophen (&#x223C;10&#x00A0;mg/kg) or fentanyl per nostril (1&#x03BC;g/kg) may be given to reduce postoperative pain and/or emergence agitation.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Tonsillectomy</strong></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen446">C. Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Tonsillar hypertrophy may be asymptomatic or lead to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and recurrent tonsillitis, which are frequent indications for removal of tonsils and/or adenoids. The tonsils grow rapidly between the ages of 1 through 3 years and are often largest between the ages of 3 to 7 years. Thus, this is the most common age range for this procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">The assessment of a child having tonsillectomy should include evaluating the overall respiratory function. If the patient&#x2019;s apnea-hypopnea index, assessed during a sleep study is severe, strong consideration should be given to a postoperative overnight stay in the intensive care unit. The worst cases of OSA may also be complicated by pulmonary hypertension with cor pulmonale and may require pharmacologic cardiovascular support during induction.</p>
<p class="indent">In the setting of an upper respiratory tract infection (URI), proceeding with the operation may increase the risk of respiratory complications. However, delaying a procedure for a patient with mild or improving symptoms often results in the patient returning on their next visit with similar or worse symptomology. Therefore, it may be sensible to proceed in the presence of a mild URI because complete optimization is rarely possible.<sup><a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page606"></a>A variety of regimens exist for improving postoperative analgesia and decreasing the incidence of postoperative delirium and PONV:</p>
<ul class="u_bullr">
<li><span>Acetaminophen 10 to 40&#x00A0;mg/kg per rectum can be given prior to incision for analgesia.</span></li>
<li><span>Dexamethasone 0.5&#x00A0;mg/kg is useful in the management of postoperative pain, edema, and PONV.</span></li>
<li><span>If opioids are required, IV fentanyl (0.25-1.0 &#x03BC;g/kg) can provide effective relief while reducing the incidence and/or severity of emergence delirium (ED).</span></li>
<li><span>Dexmedetomidine 0.5 &#x03BC;g/kg can also be bolused as prophylaxis for ED.<sup><a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> Ibuprofen PO, given either pre- or postoperatively, is a safe and effective analgesic, though some surgeons are concerned with its impact on postoperative bleeding.<sup><a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup></span></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen447">D. Posttonsillectomy Hemorrhage</h5>
<p class="nonindent">While rare (&#x003C;1%-2% of patients), posttonsillectomy hemorrhage can be life-threatening. Risk factors include chronic tonsillitis, older age (&#x003E;11&#x00A0;years), intraoperative blood loss greater than 50&#x00A0;mL, and hypertension. Primary hemorrhage occurs within 24 hours of the surgery; secondary hemorrhage typically occurs within 5 to 10&#x00A0;days of the surgery, corresponding to the time period when a fibrin clot sloughs off.</p>
<p class="indent">The management of posttonsillectomy hemorrhage starts with basic life support: airway, circulation, and breathing. Assess cardiovascular stability and obtain or increase IV access. Examine the airway, look for active bleeding or a clot, and obtain the history of any bleeding expeditiously. Keep the patient leaning forward and face down to drain blood away from the laryngopharynx. When minor or recurrent bleeding is present, there is a significant risk (perhaps&#x00A0;&#x003E;&#x00A0;40%) for severe hemorrhage to ensue, due to relaxation of vasospasm or the displacement/lysis of a clot. One must notify the blood bank and prepare for surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">In the operating room (OR), a gauze soaked in 1:10,000 epinephrine should be available. Direct pressure can be applied to tonsillar fossae using a Magill forceps wrapped with gauze. Suction and airway equipment should also be available before the patient is placed supine. Children may not tolerate efforts at hemostasis while awake and may need sedation or GA before attempts are made. Ketamine may be an excellent choice as an induction agent; it is less likely to cause respiratory compromise or to exacerbate hypotension in hypovolemic patients.<sup><a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib6">6</a>-<a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen448">E. Emergencies/Stridor</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Stridor, high-pitched or musical breathing caused by obstruction of the larynx, is a medical emergency that must be considered life-threatening. Common causes include foreign body aspiration (FBA), epiglottitis, and croup (<strong><a href="#tt29-1">Table 29.1</a></strong>).</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">FBA is a common problem in children, particularly of age 1 to 5 years, which can be difficult to diagnose unless the event was witnessed. FBA may present with wheezing and coughing, decreased breath sounds, and stridor. Also, it may mimic allergic reactions, asthma, OSA, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), bronchiolitis, or airway obstruction due to abscess or congenital anomaly. Radiography of a patient with FBA may detect atelectasis and hyperinflation without detecting the foreign body itself, which is often radiolucent. If there is a high index of suspicion for FBA, rigid bronchoscopy may be the necessary next step. (See <strong><a href="#ff29-1">Figure 29.1</a></strong>.)</p>

<p class="indent">Epiglottitis, a life-threatening condition typically caused by bacterial infection, often affects the epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, arytenoids, and uvula. Its incidence has declined in the pediatric population due to widespread vaccination against <em>Haemophilus influenzae B</em> (Hib). Other bacteria, however, including <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, may also cause epiglottitis.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Epiglottitis</em></strong> presents with stridor, drooling, odynophagia, outright avoidance of food and drink, dysphagia, and/or high fever. Other signs include malaise and agitation or a history of rapid symptom onset (within hours); absence of Hib vaccination is of obvious concern. A child growing tired or lethargic suggests impending respiratory failure necessitating that the airway be secured expeditiously. Hypotension, hypoxemia, and bradycardia are also indications for rapid intervention.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">A chest x-ray may detect atelectasis and hyperinflation, but it cannot rule out FBA if the aspirated body is radiolucent. When there is a high index of suspicion for FBA, rigid bronchoscopy may be necessary to establish a diagnosis.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">It is essential to triage and initiate treatment patients with suspected epiglottitis swiftly. Continuously monitor with pulse oximetry and administer supplemental oxygen. Do not agitate the patient as it may lead to laryngospasm. It is often necessary to forgo radiological imaging and transport to the OR. However, if stable enough for imaging, an x-ray may show the &#x201C;thumb sign&#x201D; seen on a lateral film, representing the swollen epiglottis, or the &#x201C;steeple sign&#x201D; seen on an AP film representing subglottic tracheal narrowing seen in croup.</p>

Following foreign body removal, a small endothelial laceration is visible on the posterior surface of the epiglottis (B).</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page608"></a>Keep the child upright during transport and proceed directly to the OR for an inhaled anesthetic induction with continuous positive airway pressure ventilation. After induction and IV placement, weigh the benefit of preventing laryngospasm with a neuromuscular blocking agent against the risk of abolishing spontaneous respiration should tracheal intubation fail. For direct laryngoscopy, a curved Macintosh blade placed gently into the vallecula is likely the best approach. Prevent contact with the epiglottis as this may induce bleeding or swelling. An endotracheal tube 0.5 to 1&#x00A0;mm smaller in diameter than would normally be age-appropriate should be placed due to the likelihood that edema has reduced the caliber of the airway. Smaller endotracheal tubes should also be readily available.</p>
<p class="indent">Have atropine and succinylcholine ready for IM administration to treat cardiac depression and/or laryngospasm, respectively. Alternative airway management plans are essential, and they include immediate access to rigid bronchoscopy, emergency tracheostomy, or cricothyroidotomy. Thus, concern for epiglottis warrants an ORL consult and early intubation to avoid further airway swelling and loss.</p>
<p class="indent">Postoperative sedation and mechanical ventilation allow time for airway inflammation to subside. The infection must also be cultured and treated. Extubation should only occur after visual inspection reveals that the swelling and friability of airway tissues has decreased; a leak test may be helpful in determining readiness.<sup><a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib9">9</a></sup></p>

<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Laryngotracheobronchitis, also known as croup, may cause stridor; however, it tends to have a milder course than epiglottitis.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Laryngotracheobronchitis</em></strong>, or croup, is another cause of stridor, though it tends to have a milder course than epiglottitis. Croup presents with a barking high-pitched cough and less severe systemic involvement. Consider croup in a vigorously coughing, alert toddler with a hoarse voice. For croup in an otherwise healthy child, it is unlikely that tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation will be necessary.<sup><a href="ch029-sec14.xhtml#bib9">9</a></sup></p>
