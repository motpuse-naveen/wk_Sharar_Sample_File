<h4 class="h4" id="sec31">I. The Central Nervous System</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The human nervous system is an evolutional wonder that governs all body processes serving both sensorium, executive functions, and processing the world around us. The nervous system is built from 10<sup>10</sup> neurons connected into a vast functional network. The human central nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord (<strong><a href="#ff4-1">Figure 4.1</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The olfactory nerve is the only cranial nerve whose input reaches the cerebral cortex without going through the thalamus.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The brain (encephalon) is protected by the cranium and serves as a central processor for the information coming from the trunk and limbs, conducted by the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and autonomic nervous system. There are also twelve pairs of cranial nerves connected directly to the brain serving head and neck functions.</p>
<p class="indent">The mature brain consists of four parts: brainstem, midbrain, diencephalon, and cerebrum. The brainstem (rhombencephalon) is divided into the medulla oblongata (connected directly to the spinal cord), pons, and cerebellum. The brainstem is protected by basal portions of occipital and sphenoid bones.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Pituitary Gland Hormones</strong></p>
<p class="indent">The medulla (<strong><em>center, quintessence</em></strong> in Latin) conducts all signals between the spinal cord and the brain. It also contains the cardiovascular center that processes rate and force of cardiac contraction and the diameter of the blood vessels, and the respiratory center responsible for the basic rate of breathing. The medulla also controls vomiting, sneezing, coughing, and hiccupping.</p>
<p class="indent">The pons (<strong><em>bridge</em></strong> in Latin) lies directly superior to the medulla and anterior to the cerebellum. As the name suggests, the pons serves as a connector between different parts of the brain. The pons is responsible for coordinating voluntary movement throughout the body, helps the medulla to control breathing, and serves as an origin of cranial nerves V (trigeminal), VI (abducens), VII (facial), and VIII (vestibulocochlear).</p>
<p class="indent">The cerebellum (<strong><em>small brain</em></strong> in Latin) is the second largest part of the brain after the cerebrum lies in the inferior/posterior part of calvarium. The main function of the cerebellum is coordination of voluntary movements, and maintenance of posture and balance thus enabling all goal-directed muscular activities.</p>
<p class="indent">The midbrain (mesencephalon) extends from the pons to the diencephalon and is about 2.5&#x00A0;cm (1 in) long. The midbrain transmits nerve signals from motor areas in the cerebral cortex to the medulla, pons, and spinal cord. It also contains visual centers and auditory centers governing a variety of visual and auditory reflexes. The midbrain also secretes dopamine from substantia nigra neurons and is the origin of two pairs of cranial: III (oculomotor) and IV (trochlear).</p>

<p class="indent">The diencephalon forms a central core of the brain superior to the midbrain, and contains multiple nuclei responsible for a wide variety of sensory and motor processing: the thalamus, hypothalamus, and epithalamus. The pituitary gland is attached to the hypothalamus and secretes multiple hormones.</p>
<p class="indent">The thalamus is a major relay station for most sensory signals reaching the cerebral cortex from the brainstem. It also processes cerebellar motor information to motor areas of the cerebral cortex and plays a role in maintenance of consciousness.</p>
<p class="indent">The hypothalamus (<strong><em>hypo</em></strong> means <strong><em>under</em></strong> in Latin) controls multiple body activities and is a major regulator of homeostasis of our bodies. Somatic and visceral senses arrive to the thalamus, as well as sensory input for vision, taste, and smell. Hypothalamic receptors also monitor blood glucose, osmotic pressure in the blood, and a variety of hormonal levels. The hypothalamus has multiple important functions: control of the autonomic nervous system, production<a id="page73"></a> of hormones, behavioral regulation (pain, pleasure, aggression, arousal, appetite, thirst), control of body temperature, and state of consciousness.</p>
<p class="indent">The cerebrum (triencephalon) is a center of intelligence enabling humans to learn, write, speak, remember, and work as physicians and nurses. The cerebrum consists of an outer cerebral cortex (outer region of gray matter) and deep nuclei (deeper regions of gray and white matter).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen64">A. Cerebrospinal Fluid</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Cerebrospinal fluid is clear, colorless liquid serving as a cushion to protect the brain and spinal cord from chemical and physical injuries and is contained by a combination of three meninges (pia, arachnoid, and dura mater) and bony structures of the skull and the spine.</p>
<p class="indent">Main components of spinal fluid are water, oxygen, glucose, and small amounts of proteins, urea, lactic acid, and white blood cells. Cerebrospinal fluid is secreted by choroid plexus epithelial cells in the roofs of the third and fourth ventricles at a rate of 0.4&#x00A0;mL per minute, thereby replacing total volume every 5 to 6&#x00A0;hours. Cerebrospinal fluid total volume is around 150&#x00A0;mL and is in constant flow with each heartbeat, circulating through first, second, and third cerebral ventricles, through the cerebral aqueduct in the midbrain into the fourth ventricle, and then into subarachnoid space. Gradual reabsorption into the blood through arachnoid villi eventually occurs at the same rate at which it is formed.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen65">B. Spinal Cord</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The spinal cord contains several sensory and motor pathways (<strong><a href="#ff4-2">Figure 4.2</a></strong>) while also serving as a relay and processing station for a variety of peripheral and central inputs. The adult spinal cord is 42 to 45&#x00A0;cm long with a diameter of 1.5&#x00A0;cm at the widest location (cervical enlargement spanning the C4-T1 vertebral levels).</p>
<p class="indent">The spinal cord is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, which is itself contained by three meninges (pia, arachnoid, and dura) within the vertebral canal. It is oval in cross-sectional shape, extending in adults from medulla oblongata to the superior border of the L2 vertebra (L4 in newborns), and ending distally in the conus medullaris. Arising from the conus is the filum terminale, an extension of pia, arachnoid, and dura mater that anchors the spinal cord to the coccyx.</p>
<p class="indent">The spinal cord has thirty-one segments from which thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves emerge through right and left intervertebral foramen. There are no internal divisions in the spinal cord, so as a matter of convention spinal nerves are named according to the vertebral levels where they arise: there are 8 pairs of cervical nerves (C1-C8), 12 pairs of thoracic nerves (T1-T12), 5 pairs of lumbar nerves (L1-L5), 5 pairs of sacral nerves (S1-S5), and 1 pair of coccygeal nerves (Co1). As the spinal cord ends at the L2 vertebra multiple spinal nerves (L3-Co1) must traverse the spinal canal to reach their exiting foramen, thus forming the cauda equina (<strong><em>horse tail</em></strong> in Latin).</p>
<p class="indent">Two nerve roots connect each spinal nerve to the spinal cord. Dorsal (posterior) roots contain only sensory axons conducting nerve impulses from sensory receptors of the skin, muscles, and organs to the spinal cord. In contrast, ventral (anterior) roots a contain axons of motor neurons conducting signals from the central nervous system to the periphery. Neuronal cell bodies of these peripheral nerves are located in the dorsal and ventral root ganglia.</p>

Wolters Kluwer; 2019:66-76, Figure 6.2.)</figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">A transverse section of the spinal cord resembles a dark butterfly (gray matter) surrounded by white matter (<strong><a href="#ff4-3">Figure 4.3</a></strong>). The gray matter consists of dendrites and cell bodies of neurons, unmyelinated axons, and neuroglia. The white matter consists of bundles of myelinated axons of neurons. Two grooves (anterior median fissure and posterior median sulcus) separate white matter into right and left sides. Gray matter of the spinal cord contains neuronal cell bodies combined by functions into nuclei: sensory nuclei process input from receptors, and motor nuclei provide output to effector tissues (eg, skeletal muscle). White matter of the spinal cord is organized into three columns: ventral (anterior), dorsal (posterior), and lateral. Each column contains bundles of myelinated axons (ascending sensory and descending motor) that carry similar information from the common origin to a common destination within central nervous system. Sensory and motor tracts of the spinal cord connect to sensory and motor tracts in the brain. Eventually both sensory and motor fibers cross the midline such that the left side of our bodies is innervated by the right side of our brains, and conversely.</p>
