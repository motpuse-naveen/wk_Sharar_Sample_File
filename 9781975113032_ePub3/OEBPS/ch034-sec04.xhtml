<p class="nonindent">&#x201C;Failure to rescue&#x201D; is defined as death after a potentially treatable complication and is an important measure for surgical quality improvement initiatives.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib38">38</a></sup> Complications are not only more common in older adults, but once they occur, they are significantly more likely to lead to mortality (<strong><a href="#tt34-4">Table 34.4</a></strong>).<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib39">39</a></sup> In addition, there is increasing evidence that anesthetic management may influence long-term outcomes. Older adults are particularly sensitive to the detrimental effects of anesthesia. Anesthesiologists should not only be familiar with tools to identify patients at risk but be familiar with preventive strategies and treatment modalities.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen609">A. Pain Control</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The goals of pain management are no different for an older adult than a young adult; however, they are often more difficult to achieve. Accurate assessment of pain is difficult in patients who have cognitive impairment or delirium. In addition, older adults often suffer from chronic pain conditions but tend to underreport their acute pain levels.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib40">40</a></sup> Inadequate levels of analgesia are associated with numerous adverse outcomes, including sleep deprivation, respiratory impairment, ileus, impaired mobilization, insulin resistance, tachycardia, and hypertension.</p>
<p class="indent">Postoperative pain management in older adults is further complicated by an increased incidence of side effects due to polypharmacy and age-related changes in pharmacokinetics. The side effects of opioids (such as changes in mental status, nausea, vomiting, constipation, respiratory depression and increased fall risk) are more common in older adults. Adjunctive medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce opioid requirements but often carry their own risks such as renal damage or gastrointestinal toxicity. Appropriate use of regional analgesia can reduce the need for systemic pain relievers.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib41">41</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen610">B. Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorders</h5>
<p class="nonindent">One of the most distressing concerns for older patients and their families is the potential for the development of cognitive changes after surgery. In 2018, a nomenclature for the cognitive changes that may develop throughout the perioperative period was developed by expert consensus.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib42">42</a></sup> Cognitive changes that occur after emergence from anesthesia until expected recovery from anesthesia and surgery (up to 30&#x00A0;days) are referred to as postoperative <a id="page742"></a>delirium or delayed cognitive recovery. If cognitive changes persist after the expected recovery period, they are defined as postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) or neurocognitive disorder (postoperative, for the first year). Emergence delirium, which is sometimes observed immediately after anesthesia, likely represents incomplete recovery from anesthetic agents or other conditions such as pain or a full bladder, not a neurocognitive disorder; as such, the condition might more accurately be referred to as emergence excitation.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen611">C. Postoperative Delirium or Delayed Cognitive Recovery</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Delirium is a condition of acute and fluctuating disturbance of attention and cognition. Delirium can be accompanied by perceptual disturbances, delusions, or psychomotor agitation. Delirium is associated with an increased length of stay, poorer long-term functional recovery, and increased mortality. Although delirious patients are often detected because of increased activity and agitation, older adults are more likely to present with hypoactive delirium (apathy, slow movement and speech) or a mixed subtype with both hyperactive and hypoactive features. The development of delirium (<strong><a href="#ff34-9">Figure 34.9</a></strong>) is dependent on preexisting vulnerabilities (age, fewer years of education, lower <a id="page743"></a>preoperative cognitive function, frailty and functional impairment). Surgery type is also important; for example, in surgeries that require cardiac bypass or emergency orthopedic procedures, the incidence postoperative delirium is as high as 50% to 65%.</p>
<div class="figureu5" id="ff34-9"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff34-9.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="ucaption"><span class="u_fignum">Figure&#160;34.9</span> <strong>Delirium represents a condition of waxing and waning mental status. There are multiple factors that put patients at risk for delirium. Delirium is associated with poor outcomes for patients and increased cost to the healthcare system.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">Prevention is the best strategy, as delirium can be difficult to treat. Effective preventive methods include frequent reorientation to time and place, good sleep hygiene, quick return of sensory input devices such as glasses and hearing aids, early mobilization (if walking is not possible, sitting in a chair), and adequate oral hydration and feeding. Both uncontrolled pain and excessive use of opioids or sedatives can lead to delirium. Medications with sedative effects (particularly benzodiazepines) should be prescribed cautiously if not avoided altogether. After the onset of delirium, careful use of antipsychotics can be considered.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen612">D. Postoperative Cognitive Decline</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) is condition in which a decline in neurocognitive function (especially in memory and executive functions) is diagnosed more than 30&#x00A0;days after surgery or after expected recovery from surgery. In older adults undergoing noncardiac surgery, 26% had a decline in neurocognitive function 1&#x00A0;week after surgery and 10% continue to be affected after 3&#x00A0;months (of note, 3% of matched controls who did not have surgery also had a decline in neurocognitive function after 3&#x00A0;months).<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib43">43</a></sup> These cognitive effects can persist for years and lead to reduced quality of life; they also frequently produce an economic burden on the patient and society. Unlike delirium, POCD can be difficult to diagnose, as its manifestations can be subtle, and detection often requires sophisticated neuropsychological testing.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib44">44</a></sup> Risk factors include age and reduced preoperative mental capacity; both lower levels of education and lower preoperative neuropsychologic test scores are associated with higher risk of POCD.</p>
<p class="indent">Little is known regarding the prevention and treatment of POCD. Trials have examined regional versus general anesthesia and found no differences in POCD risk; other studies are probably underpowered at least in part because of the range of neuropsychological tests used to evaluate cognition and the prolonged follow-up periods that are required.</p>

<p class="dify">Whether patients who experience postoperative delirium are at increased risk of POCD remains unclear.</p>
