<h4 class="h4" id="sec56">I. General Pharmacology of IV Anesthetics</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen110">A. Mechanism of Action</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The most commonly used IV anesthetic agents&#x2014;the barbiturates, propofol, the benzodiazepines, and etomidate&#x2014;all act at the site of the gamma aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptor, as shown schematically in <strong><a href="#ff9-1">Figure 9.1</a></strong>. GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter within the central nervous system, and its action at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor causes increased transport of<a id="page168"></a> chloride (Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) ions across the membrane and into the postsynaptic neuron. The postsynaptic neuron becomes hyperpolarized, which functionally inhibits further propagation of nerve signals. The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor is therefore a ligand-activated ion channel. It is heterogeneously composed of five subunits. IV anesthetics that bind to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor do not bind at the same location as GABA itself (the orthosteric binding site)&#x2014;instead, they bind at other locations (allosteric sites) and change the effect of GABA upon the receptor.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">These IV anesthetics are therefore positive allosteric modulators of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor and cause conformational changes in the receptor such that the action of GABA itself is potentiated and sedation occurs. The subunit composition of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors can vary: there are 19 different possible subunits arising from eight different subunit classes (<em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1&#x2013;6</sub>, <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1&#x2013;3</sub>, <em>&#x03B3;</em><sub>1&#x2013;3</sub>, <em>&#x03B4;</em>, <em>&#x03B5;</em>, <em>&#x03B8;</em>, <em>&#x03C0;</em>, and <em>&#x03C1;</em><sub>1&#x2013;3</sub>).</p>
<p class="indent">IV anesthetic agents may only be active at receptors expressing certain combinations: the benzodiazepine allosteric binding site occurs only at the interface of <em>&#x03B1;</em> and <em>&#x03B3;</em><sub>2</sub> subunits, and etomidate is active primarily at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors that contain <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub> or <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>3</sub> subunits.</p>

<p class="indent">Unlike the others, ketamine does not interact with GABA receptors. Instead, it principally binds and blockades <em>N</em>-methyl-<small>D</small>-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors. The NMDA receptor is an excitatory receptor found throughout the CNS, including areas in the spinal cord, thalamolimbic system, and nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Glutamate, the most prominent excitatory neurotransmitter within the CNS, binds to the receptor and (among many other functions) transduces signals for pain, associates sensory signals between the thalamus and cortex, and causes global excitation. Ketamine causes analgesia by blocking the pain signal at the spinal cord and by &#x201C;disassociating&#x201D; the communication of pain between the thalamus and limbic system. This state of &#x201C;dissociative amnesia&#x201D; causes the patient<a id="page169"></a> to appear conscious (eyes open, staring) but unresponsive to sensory input (pain, questioning).</p>

<p class="indent">Ketamine also causes catecholamine release, though the mechanism of action is complex. It is theorized that ketamine blocks the NMDA receptors within the NTS preventing inhibition of the vasomotor center, resulting in a positive release of catecholamines. In isolation, ketamine is a direct myocardial depressant, but secondary to the indirect release of catecholamines, it acts as a cardiac stimulant, causing increased blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output. Some caution is required in patients with preexisting sympathetic blockade, such as those with spinal cord lesions, or those with exhaustion of their catecholamine stores, such as patients with shock trauma, for they will not produce these indirect cardiac stimulatory effects. Ketamine also blockades nicotinic, muscarinic, monoaminergic, sodium, calcium, and even kappa opioid receptors. The inhibition of sodium channels provides a modest local anesthetic action, while blockade of calcium channels causes vasodilation.</p>
<p class="indent">Dexmedetomidine is an <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist with a high ratio of specificity for the <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub> versus the <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub> receptor at 1600:1. Clonidine, an antihypertensive drug in the same category, exhibits a specificity ratio of 200:1. <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub> receptors are located presynaptically and centrally in the locus ceruleus, an area of the brain responsible for arousal and sympathetic activity. <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub> receptors are inhibitory receptors and, when activated, decrease downstream neurotransmitter release. For sympathetic nerves, this results in less catecholamine release, which causes decreased blood pressure and heart rate. <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub> receptors are also located on axons in the spinal cord involved in pain transmission. When activated, nociceptive transmission is decreased and the perception of pain is attenuated. Activating <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub> receptors in the locus ceruleus cause sedation and decreased sympathetic activity.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen111">B. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pharmacokinetics, in its simplest terms, can be defined as &#x201C;what the body does to the drug.&#x201D; Its literal meaning also brings light to its definition &#x201C;the movement of drug in the body.&#x201D; This movement can be broken into three processes: absorption, distribution, and elimination. All IV anesthetics are lipophilic and, thus when injected, are rapidly absorbed. The prompt sedating effect of IV anesthetics can be attributed to their high lipid profile and the high proportion of cardiac output (20%) that goes to the brain.</p>
<p class="indent">The distribution and elimination of IV anesthetic medications within the body can be closely approximated with a simplified three-compartment model of the body. In this model, medications are administered into a first well-mixed central compartment (the brain). Diffusion occurs back and forth between this first compartment and the additional second and third peripheral compartments (muscle, fat). The diffusion constants (shown as <em>k</em> in <strong><a href="#ff9-2">Figure 9.2</a></strong>) are such that one peripheral compartment equilibrates quickly with the central compartment and the other equilibrates more slowly. The drug is not pharmacologically active in these peripheral compartments: instead, they act as reservoirs into which medications are redistributed and sequestered. These peripheral compartments model the way in which the action of the medication may be terminated by redistribution, and also the way in which accumulation of medication within these peripheral compartments can lead to progressively increasing context-sensitive half-times as medication diffuses back into the central compartment. An effect site<a id="page170"></a> compartment models the receptor population at which the medication has its mechanism of action. Diffusion also occurs between the central compartment and the effect site compartment, but because the quantity of drug bound to receptors at any given moment is tiny compared to the total quantity of medication in the body, the effect site compartment is assumed to be sufficiently small that its effect on the mass of medication within the central compartment is negligible.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff9-2"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff9-2.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="caption"><span class="fignum">Figure&#160;9.2</span> Three-compartment model for the pharmacokinetic modeling of intravenous medication administration, redistribution, and elimination. Additionally, an effect site compartment is present. The volume of this compartment is assumed to be sufficiently small that the effect on the quantity of medication in the central compartment is negligible.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p class="indent">After distribution, the main form of elimination for IV anesthetics is through hepatic metabolism. IV anesthetics will undergo hepatic enzymatic breakdown via phase I cytochrome P450 (CYP) or phase II glucuronidation. These water-soluble metabolites are then renally excreted. Some metabolites still exhibit pharmacological activity (eg, norketamine).</p>
<p class="indent">Although each IV anesthetic travels through similar pathways of absorption, distribution, and elimination, the trajectory is not exact and individual variability exists. Considerations include the amount of protein binding, hepatic function, renal function, preexisting diseases, age, the type of surgery (eg, laparoscopic), body temperature, and drug interactions.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen112">C. Pharmacodynamic Effects</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Pharmacodynamics (PD), in its simplest terms, is defined as &#x201C;what the drug does to the body.&#x201D; Perhaps, a better definition is the relationship between drug concentration in the body and any resulting effects, whether therapeutic or adverse.</p>
<p class="indent">Particularly important PD parameters include efficacy (activity) and potency (affinity). Efficacy is defined as the maximum effect that a drug<a id="page171"></a> can produce regardless of dose, whereas potency is the amount of drug required to produce a given effect. If the drug has low affinity for its receptor, potency will be decreased. A drug may have very high efficacy once bound to its receptor, but if the drug has little affinity, a large dose of medication will be required before maximum efficacy is met. This drug would have little potency despite having high efficacy. On the contrary, a drug may have very little effect once it binds to its receptor but is able to meet its maximum efficacy quickly due to high affinity for its binding site. This drug, although highly potent, would have little efficacy (<strong><a href="#ff9-3">Figures 9.3</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#ff9-4">9.4</a></strong>). The EC<sub>50</sub> is the concentration or dose of drug that produces 50% of maximum effect. The lower the EC<sub>50</sub>, the more potent the drug. The EC<sub>50</sub> can be used to determine the range of target concentrations necessary for effective therapy (ie, the therapeutic window).<sup><a href="ch009-sec03.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> The therapeutic index is the measurement of the relative safety of a drug. All IV anesthetics have low therapeutic indices&#x2014;a close margin between the concentration of a drug that is therapeutic versus the concentration that is deadly, and this is why a provider specifically trained in administering these medications is crucial to the safety of the patient.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen113">D. Hypersensitivity (Allergic) Reactions</h5>
<p class="nonindent">It is important to acknowledge that, although allergic reactions can occur, the most common causes of hypotension immediately following induction with IV anesthetic agents are unrecognized hypovolemia and/or unexpected drug interactions. True hypersensitivity reactions are rare, although case reports of histamine release with all IV anesthetic agents, with the exception of etomidate, have been alleged. In fact, because of its lack of histamine release, etomidate is considered to be the most &#x201C;immunologically safe&#x201D; IV anesthetic. Propofol does not normally cause histamine release, but anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients with multiple drug allergies. Barbiturates can precipitate acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) in susceptible patients.</p>
