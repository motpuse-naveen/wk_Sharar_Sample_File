<h4 class="h4" id="sec10">III. Breathing and Lung Mechanics</h4>
<p class="nonindent">The generation of a breath, which allows for the inflow of atmospheric air into the lungs and outflow of carbon dioxide&#x2013;rich air from the alveoli, is a function of periodic changes in partial pressure gradients. The manner in which pressure gradients are achieved depends on whether a breath is spontaneously or mechanically generated.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen16">A. Spontaneous Ventilation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Except in the case of alveolar collapse, the pressure within the alveoli is greater than the intrathoracic pressure surrounding the lung parenchyma. This alveolar pressure is generally atmospheric at end expiration and end inspiration. Intrapleural pressure is approximately &#x2212;5&#x00A0;cm water (H<sub>2</sub>O) at end expiration and can be approximated with an esophageal balloon. Using zero as a reference for atmospheric pressure during a no-flow state at end expiration, the end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (TPP) can be calculated:</p>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/13-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<a id="page14"></a>
<p class="indent">When the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract and inspiration occurs, the intrathoracic volume increases and a new intrapleural pressure is generated, approximately &#x2212;8 to &#x2212;9&#x00A0;cm&#x00A0;H<sub>2</sub>O. Alveolar pressure also decreases to &#x2212;3 to &#x2212;4&#x00A0;cm&#x00A0;H<sub>2</sub>O, maintaining the TPP at 5&#x00A0;cm&#x00A0;H<sub>2</sub>O, but generating a pressure gradient between the alveoli and upper airway. This change allows for air to flow down the gradient into the alveoli leading to expansion of alveoli and participation in gas exchange.</p>
<p class="indent">When the diaphragm and intercostals relax, the intrapleural pressure returns to &#x2212;5&#x00A0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O. TPP does not support the expanded alveoli at these intrathoracic volumes, and they begin to collapse. The air flows from the alveoli out toward the upper airway, and the previous end-expiratory pressures and alveolar size are reestablished.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen17">B. Mechanical Ventilation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Most mechanical ventilation modes involve the application of positive pressure with each breath. As positive pressure is delivered, the alveoli expand, and gas flows to the alveoli until alveolar pressure equals that in the upper airway. When the positive pressure breath is stopped, expiration occurs passively until another positive pressure breath is delivered<sup><a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib2">2</a>,<a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup> (<a href="ch042.xhtml">Chapter 42: Critical Care</a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen18">C. Movement of the Lung Parenchyma</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The movement of the lung tissue itself is passive and depends on overcoming two types of resistance: elastic resistance of the lung parenchyma, chest wall, and gas-liquid interface in the alveoli and nonelastic resistance of the airways to gas flow. The work necessary to overcome these two resistances is the physiologic work of breathing.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen19">D. Elastic Resistance</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Both the lung parenchyma and thoracic cavity have their own elastic recoil properties. The tendency of the lungs to collapse is due to the high number of elastin fibers within the tissue as well as the surface tension at the air-fluid interface of the alveoli. The tendency of the chest wall is to move outward due to its structural makeup and muscle tone.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen20">E. Surface Tension</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Alveoli are lined by a thin surface fluid layer. This fluid layer creates surface tension favoring collapse of the alveolus. In order for the alveolus to remain inflated, the pressure keeping the alveolus open must be greater than the surface tension created by the surface fluid layer. Laplace law helps to quantify the pressure within the alveolus with a given surface tension:</p>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/14-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="indent">As demonstrated by the equation, the higher the surface tension, the greater the propensity of the alveolus to collapse. To overcome this tendency to collapse, the lung produces surfactant at the gas-fluid interface. Surfactant reduces surface tension, allowing the alveolus to more readily stay expanded. The higher the concentration of surfactant in an alveolus, the more the surface tension is reduced. Conversely, as the concentration decreases, the effect on surface tension decreases. This relationship helps to stabilize the alveoli. As the alveolus decreases in size, the concentration of<a id="page15"></a> surfactant increases, helping to prevent collapse. As the alveolus begins to over distend, the surfactant concentration decreases and alveolar shrinkage is favored.<sup><a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib2">2</a>,<a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen21">F. Compliance</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Compliance is a useful measure of elastic recoil. It is defined as a change in volume divided by the change in pressure:</p>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/15-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="indent">The higher the pressure needed to produce a specific change in volume, the lower the compliance of the system and the higher the elastic recoil of that same system.</p>
<p class="indent">Compliance can be calculated for both the lung and the chest wall separately. Normal lung compliance is 150 to 200&#x00A0;mL/cm H<sub>2</sub>O and is defined as</p>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/15-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="indent">Chest wall compliance is normally 100&#x00A0;mL/cm H<sub>2</sub>O and is defined as</p>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/15-3.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="nonindent">where transthoracic pressure equals atmospheric pressure minus intrapleural pressure.</p>
<p class="indent">Total respiratory compliance of chest wall and lung compliance is normally 80 to 100&#x00A0;mL/cm H<sub>2</sub>O. It is defined mathematically as</p>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/15-4.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="indent">Compliance can be affected by the presence of secretions, inflammation, fibrosis, fluid overload, and a host of other factors. It is a useful measure, especially in the setting of mechanical ventilation, to demonstrate worsening or improvement of lung mechanics.<sup><a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib2">2</a>,<a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen22">G. Transpulmonary Pressure</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Transpulmonary pressure (TPP) is the true distending pressure within the alveoli. Calculation of the TPP requires the measurement of intrapleural pressure, but this is rarely done directly. Rather, esophageal pressure, a surrogate marker of pleural pressure, can be measured with an esophageal balloon catheter. Titration of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to maintain a zero to positive TPP can improve alveolar overdistention/collapse leading to improved lung recruitment.<sup><a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> Plateau pressure is a surrogate of alveolar pressure. For example, if a patient continues to be hypoxemic with a plateau pressure of 20&#x00A0;cm&#x00A0;H<sub>2</sub>O, the PEEP should be titrated up to where the measured esophageal pressure is 20&#x00A0;cm&#x00A0;H<sub>2</sub>O to maintain a TPP of zero (<strong><a href="#ff2-1">Figure 2.1</a></strong>).</p>
