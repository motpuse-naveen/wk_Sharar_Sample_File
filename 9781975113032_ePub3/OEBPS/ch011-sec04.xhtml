<h5 class="h5" id="sen156">A. Characteristics of Nondepolarizing Blockade</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nondepolarizing NMBAs compete with ACh for binding to one or both of the &#x03B1; subunits of the muscular nAChRs, inhibiting activation (<strong><a href="#ff11-5">Figure 11.5</a></strong>). They also bind and inactivate neuronal presynaptic nAChRs which explains why repetitive stimulation (0.1-2 Hz) during partial block leads to muscle contraction fade. The degree of fade can be determined by a sequence of four stimuli delivered at 2&#x00A0;Hz by calculating the ratio of the amplitude of the fourth response (T4) to the amplitude of the first response (T1). This is the train-of-four ratio (TOFR or T4/T1). Another characteristic of nondepolarizing block is the transient amplification of responses that follows a 5-second period of tetanic stimulation (posttetanic potentiation) that lasts up to 3 minutes following tetanic stimulation. Unlike depolarizing blockade, which is potentiated by the administration of anticholinesterases, the nondepolarizing block can be antagonized by anticholinesterases if the level of block is sufficiently shallow (see &#x201C;Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockade&#x201D;).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen157">B. Pharmacology of Nondepolarizing Neuromuscular Blocking Drugs</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nondepolarizing NMBAs can be classified as long, intermediate, and short acting, and their duration of action depends on metabolism, redistribution, and elimination (<strong><a href="ch011-sec03.xhtml#tt11-1">Tables 11.1</a> and <a href="#tt11-2">11.2</a></strong>; <strong><a href="ch011-sec03.xhtml#ff11-3">Figures 11.3</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#ff11-5">11.5</a></strong>). They also can be classified based on their chemical structure as benzylisoquinolinium (cisatracurium, mivacurium) or aminosteroid (rocuronium, vecuronium) compounds. Nondepolarizing NMBAs are almost always administered intravenously. Intramuscular delivery leads to very slow and variable onset of action. Since they are positively charged, nondepolarizing NMBAs are distributed mostly in the extracellular fluid (ECF). Thus, in patients with renal or hepatic failure (who have increased ECF), larger initial doses may be required.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen158">C. Onset and Duration of Action</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Onset of nondepolarizing NMBAs generally depends on potency; less potent agents such as rocuronium (ED<sub>95</sub> of 0.3&#x00A0;mg/kg) have more molecules per equivalent dose than a potent NMBA such as vecuronium (ED<sub>95</sub> of 0.05&#x00A0;mg/kg), resulting in faster onset. Thus, an ED<sub>95</sub> dose of rocuronium will have six times more molecules than an equipotent dose of vecuronium, and the plasma concentration of rocuronium will be greater than that of vecuronium. This greater concentration difference between plasma and the synaptic cleft partly explains the more rapid onset of rocuronium. A similar plasma to synaptic cleft concentration gradient might be achieved by administering six times the ED<sub>95</sub> of vecuronium. Although this will speed up the onset of action, the much larger dose will also markedly prolong the total duration of action. Typically, a dose of 2 to 3&#x00A0;&#x00D7;&#x00A0;ED<sub>95</sub> of a nondepolarizing NMBA is used to facilitate tracheal intubation.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen159">D. Nondepolarizing Agents</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Vecuronium is an intermediate-duration NMBA that is devoid of cardiovascular effects; because it is more potent than rocuronium, its onset of action is slower (<strong><a href="ch011-sec03.xhtml#tt11-1">Table 11.1</a></strong>). Vecuronium can precipitate in the intravenous tubing if administered immediately after thiopental (but not propofol) administration. Since the introduction of rocuronium, vecuronium is no longer recommended for RSII.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The vecuronium metabolite (3-desacetyl) has 60% of the parent compound potency. It accumulates with large or repeated doses in intensive care patients and likely contributes to the condition of persistent paralysis in the critically ill.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Rocuronium is structurally similar to vecuronium (<strong><a href="ch011-sec03.xhtml#tt11-1">Table 11.1</a></strong>). Because of its low potency, the high plasma concentration achieved after bolus administration decreases rapidly, so that its duration of action in patients with normal renal and hepatic function is determined mostly by its redistribution, not its elimination. Unlike vecuronium, rocuronium metabolites (17-OH rocuronium) have very low neuromuscular blocking activity. Rocuronium can be used in high doses (1-1.2&#x00A0;mg/kg) in the RSII setting, particularly in those patients in whom the use of SCh is contraindicated. The mean onset time at this dose rivals that of SCh, with similar intubation conditions.<sup><a href="ch011-sec09.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup> After large doses, the DUR 25% is significantly prolonged (&#x003E;60 minutes), and if rapid reversal is considered in the &#x201C;cannot-intubate, cannot-ventilate&#x201D; scenario, a large dose (16&#x00A0;mg/kg) of sugammadex is necessary. Similar to vecuronium, rocuronium has no effect on hemodynamics and does not release histamine. However, allergic reactions have been documented. Reports from around the world suggest that the incidence of anaphylaxis following rocuronium may be higher than with other NMBAs. This has been ascribed to sensitization to an antitussive medication, pholcodine, available in some countries. Potency appears to be greater in<a id="page221"></a> women than in men, and the dose should be reduced 20% in women. In the pediatric population, onset and duration of action are shorter, and dose requirements are slightly increased.</p>

<p class="tfoot">BW, body weight; ED<sub>95</sub>, the dose required in half the population for 95% depression of a single twitch; SCh, succinylcholine. Actual BW for cisatracurium is based on conflicting data for atracurium; there are limited data on cisatracurium. Actual BW is presumed for mivacurium based on similarities with SCh pharmacodynamics.</p>
<p class="tfoot"><sup>a</sup>The information is estimated based on data from published literature, assuming there is no potentiation from other coadministered drugs (such as volatile inhalational anesthetics), and with effects measured at the adductor pollicis muscle. Other factors, such as muscle temperature, mode of evoked response monitoring, type or site of muscle monitoring, will affect the data.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Cisatracurium is a benzylisoquinolinium compound of the curare family. It is the more contemporary version of atracurium, which is composed of a mixture of 10 optical isomers (<strong><a href="#tt11-2">Table 11.2</a></strong>) that has a propensity to release histamine. Cisatracurium is composed of the cis-cis isomer, which is more potent than atracurium and does not release histamine. It has a unique, dual metabolic pathway: a nonenzymatic degradation that is directly proportional with temperature and pH (Hofmann degradation) and a secondary pathway that involves hydrolysis by nonspecific plasma esterases. As seen with more potent NMBAs, cisatracurium has a slower onset of action. Even at 3 times ED<sub>95</sub>, onset is 5 to 7 minutes, which may be shortened by increasing the dose. DUR 25% is intermediate (30-45 minutes) but is slightly more predictable than other intermediate-duration agents, likely because of the dual metabolic pathway. Potency is similar for both men and women and is not affected appreciably by age or organ failure. Allergic reactions have been reported at a low frequency.</p>

<p class="dify">Cisatracurium is metabolized by the same enzyme that degrades esmolol and remifentanil.</p>

<a id="page222"></a>
<p class="indent">Mivacurium is a benzylisoquinolinium and the only nondepolarizing NMBA with a short duration of action (<strong><a href="#tt11-2">Table 11.2</a></strong>). Potency is intermediate (ED<sub>95</sub> is 0.08-0.15&#x00A0;mg/kg) partially explaining the slow onset of action (3-4 minutes). Slow onset is also due to rapid metabolism of mivacurium en route to the neuromuscular junction. Metabolism occurs by plasma cholinesterase, similar to succinylcholine, and there are no active metabolites. Histamine release occurs at doses &#x003E;0.2&#x00A0;mg/kg, which may manifest as cutaneous flushing, erythema, and hypotension. Reversal of this drug is unique in that a buildup of ACh in the synapse by acetylcholinesterase inhibition is desired to overcome the competitive nondepolarizing block; however, inhibition of plasma cholinesterase also slows metabolism of mivacurium. Neostigmine blocks both plasma cholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase, making the preferred reversal agent for mivacurium one that only acts on acetylcholinesterase, such as edrophonium.</p>
