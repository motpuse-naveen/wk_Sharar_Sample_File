<p class="nonindent">The human liver is the largest solid organ, comprising 2% of total body mass and weighing approximately 1500&#x00A0;g. Anatomically, the liver has <strong><em>four lobes</em> (</strong><strong><em>right, left, caudate, and quadrate</em></strong><strong>)</strong> and can be further subdivided into eight segments, according to Couinaud classification. Residing behind the rib cage in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, the liver is covered in a thin connective tissue layer <strong><em>(Glisson&#x2019;s capsule)</em></strong> and is attached to the anterior abdominal wall by the falciform ligament and round ligament of the liver (umbilical cord remnant) and to the diaphragm by the coronary ligament (<strong><a href="ch006-sec02.xhtml#ff6-1">Figure 6.1</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">Key related structures of the hepatobiliary system include the <strong><em>gallbladder</em></strong> and its <strong><em>cystic duct</em></strong> outflow tract, which combines with the common hepatic duct to form the <strong><em>common bile duct</em></strong>. More distally, the common bile duct joins the pancreatic duct to form the <strong><em>hepatopancreatic ampulla (ampulla of Vater)</em></strong>, which then drains bile and pancreatic secretions into the second portion of the duodenum through the <strong><em>sphincter of Oddi</em></strong> (<strong><a href="ch006-sec02.xhtml#ff6-1">Figures 6.1</a></strong> and <strong><a href="ch006-sec02.xhtml#ff6-2">6.2</a></strong>).</p>
