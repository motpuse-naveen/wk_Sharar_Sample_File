<h5 class="h5" id="sen61">A. Capillary Diffusion, Oncotic Pressure, and Starling Law</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The ultimate purpose of the cardiovascular system is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues and to remove CO<sub>2</sub> and metabolic waste products from the cellular level. This process occurs in the rich network of capillaries that are only 5 to 10&#x00A0;&#x03BC;m in diameter, yet so overwhelming in number that the overall surface area of the network is 20 times greater than that of all the small and larger arteries. Capillary density is greatest in metabolically active tissues (eg, myocardium, skeletal muscle) and lowest in less active tissues (eg, fat, cartilage).</p>
<p class="indent">Water and solutes diffuse in both directions across the capillary wall, with water and water-soluble molecules (eg, sodium chloride, glucose) traversing the wall through clefts between adjacent endothelial cells, lipophilic molecules (oxygen, CO<sub>2</sub>) moving directly across the endothelial cells, and large molecules traversing through large clefts or by pinocytosis within endoplasmic vesicles. Thus, the capillary wall acts as a semipermeable membrane across which water, gases, and small substrates move primarily by diffusion according to concentration gradients.<sup><a href="#bib10">10</a></sup> In addition, when there is a difference between hydrostatic forces and osmotic forces across the capillary wall, water movement also occurs by filtration. In the microvasculature, osmotic pressure is largely determined by protein concentration (particularly albumin) and is termed <strong><em>oncotic pressure</em></strong>. According to the <strong><em>Starling hypothesis</em></strong>, fluid filtration across the porous capillary wall is determined by the balance between the hydrostatic and oncotic pressure gradients across the wall, as well as by the size and number of intercellular clefts. The hydrostatic pressure gradient favors water movement out of the capillary and is slightly greater than the oncotic pressure gradient that favors water movement into the capillary. The relation between these factors is governed by the <strong><em>Starling equation</em></strong>:</p>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/64-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="nonindent">where <em>F</em> is the fluid movement across the capillary wall, <em>Kf</em> is the filtration constant of the capillary membrane (reflecting its permeability), <em>Pc</em> is the capillary hydrostatic pressure (higher on the arteriolar side of the capillary than on the venular side of the capillary), <em>Pt</em> is the tissue hydrostatic pressure (typically near zero), &#x03C3; is the reflection coefficient (a correction factor for protein permeability of the capillary wall), <em>pc</em> is the plasma oncotic pressure, and <em>pi</em> is the interstitial oncotic pressure.</p>
<p class="indent">A high <em>Kf</em> indicates a highly water permeable capillary, such as in the presence of histamine (eg, airway edema that occurs during anaphylaxis), whereas a low <em>Kf</em> indicates low capillary permeability. The factors in the Starling equation including typical pressure values are illustrated in <strong><a href="#ff3-18">Figure 3.18</a></strong>.</p>

<p class="indent">The bulk flow of water and proteins across the capillary membrane is generally in the direction from the intravascular to the interstitial space. Highly permeable lymphatic capillaries collect this bulk flow in tissues and return<a id="page65"></a> the fluid and proteins (predominately albumin) through lymphatic vessels of progressively increasing size, facilitated by intermittent skeletal muscle activity, smooth muscle in the lymphatic walls, and one-way valves. The volume of fluid returned to the circulation (largely through the thoracic duct) in 24 hours is approximately equal to the total plasma volume.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff3-18"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff3-18.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="caption"><span class="fignum">Figure&#160;3.18</span> Fluid movement across the capillary membrane is determined by the permeability of the membrane to water, solutes, and protein; the hydrostatic pressure difference across the membrane; and the oncotic pressure difference across the membrane, and it is summarized by the Starling equation (see text). The hydrostatic pressure gradient varies across the length of the capillary, favoring fluid movement out of the capillary to a greater degree on the arterial end. The oncotic pressure gradient is uniform and favors fluid movement into the capillary. Net fluid movement is toward the interstitium, with lymphatic capillaries collecting the excess filtrate and returning it to the circulation.</figcaption></figure></div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen62">B. Precapillary and Postcapillary Sphincter Control</h5>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Unlike vasoconstriction in systemic arteriolar beds that adjust but do not abolish tissue blood flow, precapillary sphincters can completely occlude the vessel lumen and direct flow away from selected capillary beds (eg, shunting of blood away from the cutaneous circulation in cold environments).</p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Capillary blood flow</em></strong> in any given tissue bed is highly variable and is controlled by the precapillary and postcapillary sphincters. Transmural pressure (intravascular minus extravascular pressure) and contraction/relaxation of the precapillary and postcapillary sphincters are the primary determinants of capillary flow, with the latter mediated by both neural and local humoral factors. Unlike vasoconstriction in more proximal arteriolar beds that adjust but do not abolish tissue blood flow, precapillary sphincters can fully occlude the vessel lumen, directing flow away from capillary beds into nearby arteriovenous shunts. For example, in cold environments precapillary sphincter tone is increased to shunt blood away from cutaneous beds to retain heat. Abnormal perioperative thermoregulation occurs when this tone is impaired by various anesthetic agents. In addition, by reducing capillary flow, precapillary sphincter contraction also reduces fluid filtration due to a reduction in <em>Pc</em>. Postcapillary sphincter contraction also reduces capillary flow, but increases fluid filtration due to an increase in <em>Pc</em>.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen63">C. Viscosity and Rheology</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The flow of any fluid in any tube is always dependent on the pressure difference between ends of the tube; in the absence of a gradient, no flow will occur. As noted earlier, the simplest description of this phenomenon is the fluid mechanics analog of Ohm law (flow&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;<em>D</em> pressure/resistance). However, both tube size and physical characteristics of the fluid, particularly its viscosity (a measure of its resistance to deformation by shear forces), require a more detailed relation between flow and pressure that applies to the vascular system. Through a series of experiment in glass tubes, Poiseuille described such a relation&#x2014;the <strong><em>Poiseuille equation</em></strong>:</p>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/66-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="nonindent">where <em>r</em> is the tube radius, <em>L</em> is the tube length, and <em>&#x03B7;</em> is the <strong><em>fluid viscosity</em></strong> (a measure of a fluid&#x2019;s resistance to deformation by shear or tensile stress). Thus, although the tube radius is the most powerful determinant of flow, fluid viscosity also impacts flow.</p>
<p class="indent">Fluids with a constant viscosity (<strong><em>Newtonian fluids</em></strong>) include those with low <em>&#x03B7;</em> (water) or high <em>&#x03B7;</em> (maple syrup), and for flow within any given tube geometry, their flow is linearly related to pressure difference. However, for fluids whose viscosity is variable (<strong><em>non-Newtonian fluids</em></strong>), flow varies not only with pressure difference, but also with factors that affect viscosity. Blood has a variable viscosity that is affected by several factors, including blood constituents and blood shear rate (the velocity gradient of blood as it moves from vessel wall [low velocity] to the vessel lumen [high velocity]). Because blood is rheologically a suspension of erythrocytes in plasma, increasing the concentration of erythrocytes (hematocrit) causes the blood viscosity to increase. For example, increasing the hematocrit from 45% to 70% (polycythemia) doubles the blood viscosity, with a proportionate reduction in blood flow for any given tube diameter and pressure difference (by Poiseuille equation), with potential clinical consequences of decreased oxygen delivery to tissues. In addition, in the ventricle, high shear rates occurring during systole decrease blood viscosity and facilitate flow, in contrast to low shear rates occurring during diastole increase blood viscosity.</p>
