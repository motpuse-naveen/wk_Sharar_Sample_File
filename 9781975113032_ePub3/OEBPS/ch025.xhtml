<p class="nonindent">According to a 2017 National Health Statistics Report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2010, 48.3 million surgical and nonsurgical procedures were performed during 28.6 million ambulatory surgery visits to hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers combined.<sup><a href="ch025-sec04.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup> Self-reports from the American Hospital Association show that roughly 66% of all surgeries performed at community hospitals were performed in the outpatient setting, up from 57% in 1994.<sup><a href="ch025-sec04.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup> According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the most common ambulatory procedures were lens and cataract procedures, followed by muscle and tendon repair surgeries, such as rotator cuff repairs.<sup><a href="ch025-sec04.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup> Especially for ambulatory anesthesia, it is important that all anesthesiologists are able to formulate an appropriate anesthetic plan that allows an expeditious return of consciousness and has minimal side effects, thereby permitting timely patient discharge. Many ambulatory procedures are performed under <strong><em>monitored anesthesia care (MAC).</em></strong> In this chapter, we will discuss techniques and common medications used in ambulatory anesthesia, as well as offer an introduction to the realm of office-based anesthesia.</p>
