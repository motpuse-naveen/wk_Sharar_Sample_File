<h4 class="h4" id="sec169">I. Obesity</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Obesity is commonly defined by the patient&#x2019;s body mass index (BMI). The number of obese (BMI &#x003E;30&#x00A0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and severe obese (BMI &#x003E;40&#x00A0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) patients undergoing surgical procedures is steadily increasing. Since obese patients have an increased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality, several aspects of care need to be tailored to mitigate these risks.<sup><a href="ch028-sec03.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen426">A. Pathophysiology</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Respiratory System</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with truncal obesity have reduced ventilatory compliance, tidal volume, functional residual capacity (FRC), and vital capacity.<sup><a href="ch028-sec03.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup> As a result, they often become hypoxic much more rapidly than nonobese patients. Additionally, the impact of positioning and surgery on lung function is exaggerated because of the effects of a large abdomen on diaphragmatic position and movement, causing FRC to fall below closing capacity. Resultant small airway closure leads to atelectasis and further hypoxemia.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Obese patients become hypoxic rapidly and can tolerate only brief periods of apnea due to reduced functional residual capacity.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The metabolic activity of fat and supportive tissue increases oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) production in obese patients. This is compensated for with increased minute ventilation and cardiac output. Due to the aforementioned mechanical limitations, obese patients are often unable to increase tidal volume at times of increased oxygen need and must rely on tachypnea to improve minute ventilation.<sup><a href="ch028-sec03.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Sleep disordered breathing describes the spectrum of conditions ranging from <strong><em>obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)</em></strong> through <strong><em>obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS)</em></strong><em>.</em><sup><a href="ch028-sec03.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> Airway obstruction occurs in obese patients due to growth of adipose tissue in oral and pharyngeal structures. OSA is characterized by recurrent episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, causing hypoxia and hypercarbia. OSA occurs in up to 70% of severely obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery and is a risk factor for adverse perioperative outcomes. OHS&#x2014;also called Pickwickian syndrome&#x2014;is seen in 5% to 10% of patients with OSA. It is characterized by daytime hypercapnia, hypoventilation, and sleep disordered breathing. Patients with sleep disordered breathing are at increased risk for sedative- and opioid-related ventilatory impairment because of upper airway obstruction, depressed central respiratory drive, and impaired lung mechanics. Over the long term, OSA and OHS lead to polycythemia, systemic and pulmonary hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac dysrhythmias, right heart strain, and cor pulmonale (<strong><a href="#ff28-1">Figure 28.1</a></strong>).</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Sequelae of Obesity</strong></p>
<h6 class="h6">Cardiovascular System</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Obesity is associated with an increase in blood volume, although the weight-based blood volume is reduced (from 70&#x00A0;mL/kg in lean individuals to 50&#x00A0;mL/kg in obese patients). Obese patients are at higher risk for hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and heart failure. The combination of dyslipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension predisposes obese patients to atherosclerosis and hence coronary and cerebrovascular disease. Obesity also predisposes to a hypercoagulable state because of increased levels of procoagulant factors and decreased fibrinolysis. Obesity has been associated with an increased risk of both deep venous and thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Gastrointestinal System</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Mechanical and hormonal changes increase the risk of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in obese patients. Obesity-associated liver disease includes fatty infiltration (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease), inflammation (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis), focal necrosis, and cirrhosis. Obese patients are also at risk for cholelithiasis, particularly after intestinal bypass surgery.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><a id="page584"></a>Endocrine and Metabolic Systems</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Most cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus are attributed to obesity. Obesity is also associated with dyslipidemia&#x2014;specifically increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol, and triglycerides along with decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Obese patients often exhibit <strong><em>metabolic syndrome</em></strong> (also known as insulin resistance syndrome or syndrome X), which is a combination of risk factors that include truncal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance or impaired glucose tolerance. This increases their risk for cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality, type 2 diabetes mellitus, polycystic ovary syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cholelithiasis, and a proinflammatory state.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen427">B. Pharmacologic Principles</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Drug dosing in obesity is affected by multiple factors, including increased total body fat, reduced total body water, altered protein binding, increased blood volume and cardiac output, increased lipid concentrations in the blood, organomegaly, enhanced phase II reactions (glucuronidation and sulfation), and drug absorption in fat stores.<sup><a href="ch028-sec03.xhtml#bib5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Drugs that are mainly distributed to lean tissues (eg, nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents) should be dosed based on the <strong><em>lean body weight</em></strong> (LBW&#x00A0;&#x2248;&#x00A0;ideal body weight [IBW]&#x00A0;&#x00D7;&#x00A0;1.2). Although initial doses for lipophilic drugs (eg, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, propofol) should be based on LBW as well, maintenance doses should be based on <strong><em>total body weight (TBW)</em></strong> because of the significantly increased volume of distribution. Multiple doses of lipophilic drugs lead to accumulation in fat stores, causing a prolonged response as the drug is released back into circulation.</p>
<p class="indent">For inhaled anesthetics, the longer time constants for equilibrium with fat along with poor perfusion of fat tissue counteract the effect of increased fat mass on uptake. As a result, obesity does not influence induction times and only modestly affects the wake-up time with the inhaled anesthetics in routine clinical practice; this is especially for surgeries lasting &#x003C;4 hours. The principles for administration of commonly used perioperative drugs in obese patients are listed in <strong><a href="#tt28-1">Table 28.1</a></strong>. It must be noted that the dose-response relationships for most drugs in obese patients have not been completely elucidated.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen428">C. Preoperative Evaluation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Preoperative evaluation of the obese patient should include assessment of the risk of airway management difficulties, vascular access options, identification of comorbidities, and education of the patient regarding the perioperative anesthetic plan. Preoperative medical management of the comorbidities, when possible, may help reduce the perioperative risk.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a high prevalence of difficult airways in obese patients due to a large tongue, perimandibular and nuchal fat tissue, and redundant pharyngeal soft tissue. OSA independently correlates with difficult mask ventilation. Difficult intubation rates in obese patients range from 5% to 15% and up to 21% in patients with OSA. Male sex, neck circumference, and Mallampati score have been shown to predict difficult intubation in obese patients, although these results are inconsistent across multiple studies and the positive predictive value for each factor is low. Laryngoscopic view is improved in morbidly obese patients with the use of a video laryngoscope. The ramped position, as described later, also improves laryngoscopic view.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page586"></a>Preoperative evaluation for OSA and initiation of at-home continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for patients with OSA is recommended. In the absence of a formal preoperative sleep study, tools like the <strong><em>STOP-BANG</em></strong> questionnaire can help identify patients with OSA. The questionnaire consists of questions on <strong><em>S</em></strong>noring, <strong><em>T</em></strong>iredness, <strong><em>O</em></strong>bserved apnea, high blood <strong><em>P</em></strong>ressure, <strong><em>B</em></strong>MI &#x003E;35&#x00A0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <strong><em>A</em></strong>ge &#x003E;50&#x00A0;years, <strong><em>N</em></strong>eck circumference &#x003E;40&#x00A0;cm, and male <strong><em>G</em></strong>ender, with positive answers to three or more questions suggesting a higher risk for OSA. Elective surgeries on patients with well-controlled OSA, who are compliant with positive airway pressure (PAP) devices can proceed without further evaluation. For patients with proven OSA not treated with PAP therapy, preoperative cardiopulmonary optimization should be considered. However, urgent and emergency surgery should not be postponed for a formal diagnosis of OSA or to institute treatment. Patients who are on PAP therapy for OSA should continue treatment up to the day of surgery and should bring their PAP device with them on the day of surgery for postoperative use.</p>
<p class="indent">The American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Advisory on Cardiovascular Evaluation and Management of Severely Obese Patients Undergoing Surgery recommends that severely obese patients with at least one risk factor for coronary artery disease (diabetes, smoking, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia) or poor exercise tolerance should have a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest radiograph prior to surgery, since their cardiac symptoms can easily be masked by obesity-related issues. Preoperative cardiac evaluation and management, otherwise, is similar to patients with a normal BMI.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen429">D. Preoperative Planning and Type of Anesthetic</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Availability of appropriate weighing scale, gowns, chairs, transport beds, and monitors should be checked prior to arrival. Patients should be asked to trim their beard preoperatively. Operating rooms should be equipped with suitable sized operating tables and gel pads for positioning. Extra personnel should be available to help with patient positioning. An experienced surgeon and anesthesiologist are ideal for severely obese patients.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitored Anesthesia Care and Sedation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The risks associated with procedural sedation in the obese patient should not be underestimated. There should be close monitoring of respiratory function because of preexisting respiratory compromise, increased risk of respiratory depression with sedation, and the potential for difficult mask ventilation and intubation. The presence of OSA increases the risk of perioperative hypoxemia and the requirement of airway interventions during sedation. Dexmedetomidine is a selective &#x03B1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist that provides sedation without respiratory depression. However, its clinical use can be limited because of hemodynamic instability.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Regional Anesthesia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">The 2014 American Society of Anesthesiologists&#x2019; (ASA) practice guidelines for management of patients with OSA recommend that regional analgesic techniques be considered to reduce or eliminate the requirement for systemic opioids.<sup><a href="ch028-sec03.xhtml#bib6">6</a></sup> However, excessive sedation used to perform or manage the regional anesthetic may negate the advantages. In addition, obesity may make both neuraxial and peripheral nerve blocks more difficult to perform and may be associated with higher block failure rates. Ultrasound guidance can reduce <a id="page587"></a>procedure time and improve procedural success; however, imaging may be suboptimal due to increased depth of target structures. Retraction and taping of excessive soft tissue away from the procedural site allow for sterile preparation and easier access to insertion sites. Local anesthetic dosing for peripheral nerve blocks in obese patients should be based on IBW rather than TBW to avoid systemic toxicity.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Neuraxial Techniques</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Spinal or epidural placement in the sitting position allows for easier identification of the vertebral midline. Ultrasound can be used to identify the spinous processes and to reduce the number of needle passes. When longer needles are used, a careful assessment of the midline will avoid injury. Obese patients have decreased cerebrospinal fluid volume due to fatty tissue spread into intervertebral foramina and engorged epidural veins resulting from elevated venous pressure. Additionally, large buttocks can cause a head-down tilt of the vertebral column. Hence during spinal anesthesia, local anesthetics and opioids can have an exaggerated cephalad spread. A ramp under the chest elevates the cervical and thoracic spine, limiting cephalad spread of hyperbaric local anesthetic.</p>
<p class="indent">Epidural placement can be challenging because needle transit through fat planes can produce a false sense of loss of resistance and difficulty in predicting the depth of the epidural space. There is a higher initial failure rate for epidural catheters in obese laboring patients than in lean patients.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Obese patients require less epidural local anesthetic than normal weight patients to achieve a comparable level of anesthetic block.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">General Anesthesia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Obese patients undergoing sedation should be consented for general anesthesia because of the risk of airway obstruction and respiratory depression and the chances for a failed regional anesthetic nerve block. Deeper levels of sedation should be avoided, and an early plan for general anesthesia should be considered. General anesthesia offers the ability to control ventilation and protect the airway. However, the airway and cardiopulmonary side effects of general anesthesia in obese patients require proper planning and close monitoring.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Ambulatory Versus Inpatient Surgery</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Severely obese (BMI &#x003E;40&#x00A0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) patients undergoing procedures that require general anesthesia and postoperative opioid administration often require overnight admission and observation in an inpatient unit because of an increased risk of perioperative complications.<sup><a href="ch028-sec03.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup> As such, in general, their procedures should not be performed in isolated ambulatory surgery centers but rather in a hospital site that can handle their potentially complicated postoperative course.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen430">E. Intraoperative Considerations</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Premedication</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Although obesity is a risk factor for GERD, gastric emptying is not delayed by obesity alone. However, comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus may cause gastroparesis. In general, standard nil per os (NPO) guidelines should be followed. Antacids, prokinetics, H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists, and/or proton-pump inhibitors should be administered prior to induction in patients with an identifiable risk of aspiration but not routinely. Preprocedural sedation should only be given in conjunction with continuous monitoring of respiration and oxygenation.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><a id="page588"></a>Positioning</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Whenever possible, patients should position themselves on the operating table. In extreme cases, a mechanical lifting device may be required to move the patient. Specially designed tables are required for surgery in the extremely obese. Well-padded sleds or arm boards are often required to position the arms. For surgeries that require tilting or turning of the table, strapping or taping the patient to the table along with stiffened &#x201C;bean bags&#x201D; can prevent accidental falls. Gel and foam pads should be used to support pressure points and prevent peripheral neuropathy and skin breakdown. The supine position is associated with reduction in lung volumes and hypoxemia, and venous return may be impeded through caval compression. In the prone position, emphasis should be placed on ensuring free abdominal wall movement, with support for the chest wall and the pelvis. The Trendelenburg position causes the highest degree of respiratory compromise, with a decrease in FRC and lung compliance. Shoulder bars may cause injury to the brachial plexus if incorrectly placed. Lateral positioning and the sitting position allow the weight of the abdominal fat to fall away from the chest and diaphragm (<strong><a href="#ff28-2">Figure 28.2</a></strong>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Monitoring and Vascular Access</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Noninvasive monitoring of blood pressure overestimates the blood pressure in a large proportion of obese patients because of inappropriate cuff size and the conical shape of the obese arm. Also, recording times may be prolonged, leading to delayed recognition of changes in blood pressure. The forearm offers an <a id="page589"></a>alternative site for blood pressure measurement and appears to provide reasonably accurate results. The use of invasive monitoring should be considered, especially in the presence of comorbid conditions. Peripheral venous access can also be challenging and may require ultrasound guidance.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Airway Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">With induction of anesthesia in the supine position, obese patients experience a further reduction of FRC, and oxygen saturation may fall rapidly. Maneuvers that prolong safe apnea times during induction include preoxygenation with 100% oxygen at a high flow rate (approximately twice the minute ventilation), application of 10&#x00A0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O CPAP during preoxygenation, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during mask ventilation, and the use of a 25- to 30-degree reverse Trendelenburg or semisitting beach-chair position. The head-up position also minimizes the risk of passive gastric regurgitation.</p>
<p class="indent">Mask ventilation is usually difficult in obese patients. Use of an oral or nasopharyngeal airway, or a two-handed approach is often helpful. Appropriate planning based on the ASA difficult airway algorithm is necessary, particularly before muscle relaxants are administered.</p>
<p class="indent">In severely obese patients, supraglottic airways (SGAs) are generally not preferred because of the risk of hypoventilation during spontaneous ventilation. During positive pressure ventilation, an SGA may not maintain a seal at the higher airway pressures needed in obese patients. Decisions about airway choice should be made for individual patients, taking into consideration the grade and distribution of obesity, the type and length of surgery, and the intraoperative patient position. When SGAs are used, second-generation devices, which allow for higher seal pressures and provide a port for gastric decompression, are frequently employed.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The best position for inducing anesthesia in obese patients is a semisitting position using a ramp to place the patient&#x2019;s ears at the level of the anterior chest wall.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Intubation may be more challenging in obese patients. Placing the patient in a ramped position can facilitate laryngoscopic visualization of the vocal cords. Positioning can be achieved with towels or folded blankets under the patient&#x2019;s shoulders and head or with a commercially available device. The head, shoulders, and upper body are elevated above the chest, with the goal of positioning the external auditory meatus at the level of the anterior chest wall (<strong><a href="#ff28-3">Figure 28.3</a></strong>).</p>
<h6 class="h6">Mechanical Ventilation</h6>
<p class="nonindent">There is no clear evidence of a benefit to volume-controlled versus pressure-controlled ventilation in obese patients. Tidal volumes of 6 to 8&#x00A0;mL/kg IBW with PEEP are recommended for intraoperative ventilation. Alveolar recruitment maneuvers and subsequent application of moderate PEEP (10&#x00A0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O) helps prevent atelectasis, particularly in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Reduced ventilatory compliance can cause high airway pressures, making it difficult to maintain plateau pressures &#x003C;30&#x00A0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O, especially with pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgeries. High airway pressures can cause barotrauma and hypotension. Hypercapnia may have to be tolerated. However, hypercapnia can result in a further increase of pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with preexisting pulmonary hypertension.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Fluid Management</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Obese patients may suffer increased perioperative blood loss because of technical difficulties with surgical exposure. It may also be more difficult to estimate fluid balance, adequacy of peripheral perfusion, and blood loss in obese patients. Measurement of urine output, venous pressures, pulse pressure variation, and acid-base status may be helpful.</p>
<a id="page590"></a>
<div class="figureu5" id="ff28-3"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff28-3.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="ucaption"><span class="u_fignum">Figure&#160;28.3</span> <strong>Positioning of an obese patient supine on the operating table with use of an upper body (shoulder/head) &#x201C;ramp&#x201D; will likely enhance laryngoscopic view of the vocal cords and facilitate tracheal intubation. The goal of such positioning is to bring a line drawn between the external auditory meatus and the sternal notch (<em>yellow line</em>) into a position parallel to the horizontal plane (<em>red line</em>). Standard supine positioning (<em>left</em>) demonstrates a 30&#x00B0; difference between these two lines, whereas proper ramp positioning (<em>right</em>) has reduced this angle to only 10&#x00B0;.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<h6 class="h6">Analgesia</h6>
<p class="nonindent">A multimodal, opioid-sparing approach to analgesia should be used for all obese patients. This includes use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ketorolac and acetaminophen; local anesthetic wound infiltration; adjuncts like ketamine; alpha-2 agonists (eg, clonidine and dexmedetomidine); magnesium; systemic lidocaine; and gabapentin.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Emergence</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Precautions similar to induction should be observed. Patients should be extubated when neuromuscular blockade has been completely reversed (ideally assessed quantitatively) and the patient is awake. Use of a semisitting or reverse Trendelenburg position is helpful. Postoperative lung function is improved with application of some form of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) immediately after extubation.</p>

<p class="nonindent">Surgical treatment of obesity is generally considered if BMI is &#x003E;40&#x00A0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (or BMI &#x003E;35&#x00A0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> with obesity-related comorbidities) and the patient is unable to maintain weight loss with medical management. All of the intraoperative recommendations noted previously should be considered (eg, positioning, padding, extubation, etc.). Continuation of home CPAP therapy in the immediate postoperative period, along with a semiupright position, aids in maintaining oxygenation after surgery. Postoperative nausea and vomiting can cause disruption of gastric repair. In addition to antiemetics, adequate fluid replacement reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting in bariatric surgery patients. An opioid-sparing postoperative analgesia strategy includes local anesthetic <a id="page591"></a>wound infiltration, intravenous acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and thoracic epidural infusion of local anesthetics. Implementation of bariatric clinical care pathways improves patient care and reduces cost.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen432">G. Postoperative Management, Critical Care, and Resuscitation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Postoperatively, severely obese patients are at increased risk for prolonged mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Mobilization, incentive spirometry, and judicious handling of analgesia and sedation are required to prevent reintubation in the postanesthesia care unit. NIPPV provides ventilatory support through an external interface such as a nasal or oronasal mask. The provision of positive pressure into the nasopharynx or oropharynx helps keep open the airway, reduce alveolar decruitment, and increase lung volumes. Patients should have continuous pulse oximetry monitoring until they have demonstrated that they can maintain adequate oxygenation when left unstimulated. Patients who cannot maintain adequate oxygenation when left undisturbed should not be discharged from the hospital.</p>

<p class="dify">First-line management of postoperative hypoxemia in the obese patient should be some form of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Tracheal intubation should be used as a method of last resort.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Postoperative anticoagulation for a prolonged period (eg, heparin 5000-7500 U three times daily for 10&#x00A0;days) is helpful to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in obese patients. Early, high-protein, hypocaloric enteral feeding provides an anabolic advantage, reduces infectious complications, and reduces ICU stays. Frequent repositioning of the patient, use of pressure-relief mattresses, and early mobilization will prevent decubitus ulcers. Appropriate antibiotic dosing and redosing, prevention of hyperglycemia, and maintenance of arterial and tissue oxygenation are required to prevent surgical site infections.</p>
<p class="indent">Should cardiopulmonary resuscitation be required, it may be difficult to provide effective chest compressions. Repeat defibrillation shocks may be necessary because of the higher transthoracic impedance. Although airway management by conventional means can be challenging, surgical access through a thick neck can also be extremely difficult.</p>
