<h5 class="h5" id="sen335">A. Psoas Compartment Block</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong><em>psoas compartment block</em></strong> is useful for unilateral hip or anterior leg surgery in combination with sciatic nerve block and is often performed with guidance of a nerve stimulator to obtain a quadriceps twitch response. This response is often obtained when a 100-mm insulated block needle is inserted 1 to 2&#x00A0;cm deep to the L4 (sometimes L3) transverse process. Due to the concern of hematoma, retroperitoneal bleeding, or epidural spread, careful consideration and monitoring in addition to an experienced practitioner are mandatory for safe and effective completion of this advanced block.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Ultrasound-guided Femoral Nerve Block</strong></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen336">B. Femoral Nerve Block</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The femoral nerve can be blocked at the level of the inguinal crease with or without ultrasound guidance. With the patient in the supine position, the femoral artery pulse is palpated. The needle insertion site for the landmark approach is 1 to 1.5&#x00A0;cm lateral to the femoral pulse with a slight cephalad trajectory of about 30&#x00B0;. The goal is to obtain a patellar or quadriceps response at &#x003C;0.5&#x00A0;mA.</p>
<p class="indent">When performing the <strong><em>femoral nerve block</em></strong> with ultrasound, the femoral artery is visualized at the inguinal crease. The femoral nerve appears as a hyperechoic triangular structure lateral to the artery (<strong><a href="#ff21-15">Figure 21.15</a></strong>). Nerve stimulation can be used in combination with ultrasound to confirm a patellar or quadriceps response.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen337">C. Saphenous Nerve Block</h5>
<p class="nonindent">A <strong><em>saphenous nerve block</em></strong> can be performed for anesthesia of the medial calf and ankle. This block can be performed at the anterior midthigh level using ultrasound guidance by locating a hyperechoic structure adjacent to the superficial femoral artery, deep to the sartorius muscle (<strong><a href="#ff21-16">Figure 21.16</a></strong>).</p>

<a id="page458"></a>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen338">D. Sciatic Nerve Block</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The <strong><em>sciatic nerve block</em></strong> provides complete anesthesia to the ankle and foot when combined with a saphenous nerve block. Surgeries such as mid- and hindfoot fusions, open reductions and internal fixations of ankle fractures, Achilles tendon repairs, and total ankle arthroplasties can all be performed with sciatic-saphenous nerve anesthesia with minimal intraoperative sedation required.</p>
<p class="indent">Classically the gluteal approach (Labat) has been used, but with the popularity of ultrasound and the ease of visualization of the sciatic nerve at the level of the gluteal crease, more distal approaches have come into favor. The landmarks for the gluteal approach include an oblique line from the posterior superior iliac spine to the greater trochanter of the femur with the patient in a semiprone position with the hip and knee flexed and the operative side up. A second line from the greater trochanter of the femur to the sacral hiatus is drawn. A third line, perpendicular to the first line, will cross the second line at the approximate needle entry point (<strong><a href="#ff21-17">Figure 21.17</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">An ultrasound-guided subgluteal approach can be performed with the patient either lateral or prone. Either a high-frequency probe or a lower frequency probe can be used. Many high-frequency probes penetrate up to 6&#x00A0;cm, and thus, the vast majority of sciatic nerves may be visible with a high-frequency probe, reducing the need to switch probes between various blocks. The nerve is visualized slightly deep and lateral to the biceps femoris muscle (<strong><a href="#ff21-18">Figure 21.18</a></strong>). A nerve stimulator can be used to confirm proper identification of the sciatic nerve. A plantar flexion motor response in the foot indicates that the medial (tibial) component of the nerve is being stimulated. A dorsiflexion (common peroneal) or an eversion (superficial peroneal) response indicates the lateral components of the nerve are being stimulated. An inversion response is considered optimal and signifies that both components (tibial and peroneal) are being stimulated. Regardless of stimulation, local anesthetic spread should be visualized surrounding both components of the sciatic nerve.</p>

<p class="indent">The popliteal block is a distal sciatic block performed proximal to the popliteal fossa. The nerve may be more superficial with the distal approaches, yet if the block is attempted distal to the bifurcation of the tibial and peroneal nerves, one of the two components may be missed. Blocking approximately 10 to 15&#x00A0;cm proximal to the popliteal crease usually ensures that the two components have joined. A simple technique to locate the sciatic nerve for a distal (popliteal) approach is to begin by visualizing the popliteal artery at the popliteal fossa. The tibial nerve will be located superficial and slightly lateral to the artery and appears hyperechoic. The tibial nerve can then be traced proximally, and the peroneal nerve can be seen joining the tibial component.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen339">E. Ankle Block</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Surgery on the distal foot, including bunion surgeries, can be performed with <strong><em>ankle block</em></strong> anesthesia. Many clinicians considered the ankle block to be a &#x201C;field&#x201D; block in the past, but the use of ultrasound has made ankle block anesthesia more precise.</p>
<p class="indent">The posterior tibial nerve can be blocked using a high-frequency ultrasound probe. Scanning posterior to the medial malleolus, the posterior tibial nerve will be located slightly posterior and deep to the posterior tibial artery (<strong><a href="#ff21-19">Figure 21.19</a></strong>). The needle can be placed out of plane either superior or inferior to the probe. A nerve stimulator can be used to confirm identification of the nerve with toe flexion.</p>
<p class="indent">The deep peroneal nerve can be blocked between the upper borders of the medial and lateral malleoli, lateral to the anterior tibial artery (under<a id="page460"></a> ultrasound). The superficial peroneal nerve can be blocked via subcutaneous ring between the medial and lateral malleoli. The saphenous and sural nerves are adjacent to the greater and lesser saphenous veins, respectively, and can be blocked by subcutaneous ring or ultrasound.</p>
