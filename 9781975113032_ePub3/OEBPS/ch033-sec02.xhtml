<p class="nonindent">Administration of appropriate doses of anesthetic agents, analgesics, and all medications in the pediatric setting requires consideration of <strong><em>pharmacologic differences</em></strong> between children and adults.<sup><a href="ch033-sec09.xhtml#bib4">4</a></sup> Several variables in pediatric patients affect pharmacokinetics. For most parameters, developmental differences are greatest in neonates and premature infants. For example, total body water comprises 70% to 83% of weight in premature babies and term neonates, whereas it is approximately 60% of weight in infants 6&#x00A0;months through adulthood. Increased total body water translates to larger volumes of distribution of hydrophilic medications, which (assuming similar pharmacodynamics) translates to increased dosing requirements per kilogram of body weight. A selection of pharmacokinetic variables and their influence on drug metabolism are presented in <strong><a href="ch033-sec03.xhtml#tt33-4">Table 33.4</a></strong>. Volatile anesthetic MAC requirements are greatest at approximately 1&#x00A0;month of age.</p>
