<h4 class="h4" id="sec139">VI. Fluid Status: Assessment and Monitoring</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen366">A. Conventional Clinical Assessment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hypovolemia, defined as inadequate circulating blood volume, results from either volume depletion (ECF sodium deficit) or dehydration (ECF water deficit). Prolonged hypovolemia increases patient morbidity and mortality, yet can be rapidly corrected with fluid resuscitation. However, evidence also demonstrates poor patient outcomes with excessive fluid administration. Although the goal of fluid management and resuscitation is to maintain an effective circulating volume, many of the conventional metrics used to assess volume status do not accurately reflect intravascular volume. <strong><a href="#tt23-10">Table 23.10</a></strong> lists the most commonly used noninvasive tools for clinical assessment of volume status.</p>
<p class="indent">Physical examination findings and body weight changes are all potentially useful tools in the assessment of volume status. Caution must be used in their application, however, as concomitant pharmacotherapy (eg, beta-blockade, diuretics), comorbid conditions (congestive heart failure, chronic hepatic or renal impairment), and interobserver bias can limit the use of these clinical signs. Similarly, laboratory values, including serum electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine, are important components of volume assessment, but premorbid states can complicate their interpretation. Despite these limitations, tachycardia, oliguria, and eventually hypotension are normal physiologic responses to intravascular volume depletion. Considered together in the appropriate clinical setting, these signs frequently indicate hypovolemia and warrant an isotonic crystalloid fluid bolus challenge for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Initially, a 20 to 30&#x00A0;mL/kg fluid bolus should be administered. Serial reassessment of vital signs and laboratory values is essential to evaluate the progress of resuscitation efforts and determine whether hypovolemia is indeed the underlying problem and if further resuscitation is indicated.</p>

<p class="dify">Static measures of intravascular volume status, such as central venous pressure, do not adequately account for cardiovascular and pulmonary fluctuations over time. In contrast, dynamic measures, such as pulse pressure variation, may more accurately predict patients who will respond to volume resuscitation.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen367">B. Intraoperative Clinical Assessment</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Although physical examination and laboratory assessment also play a role in the evaluation of volume status in the operating room, the increased acuity and frequent changes in intravascular volume in this setting make invasive measures of volume status of paramount importance. Static measures of volume status that are used intraoperatively include central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, and inferior vena cava diameter. Once thought to be highly accurate measurements of intravascular volume status, recent evidence has shown these static measurements to be neither accurate measures of intravascular volume nor accurate predictors of fluid responsiveness. Coupled with the fact that these measures are heavily influenced by mechanical ventilation and perturbations in cardiac function, they have fallen out of favor as primary measures of volume status.</p>
<p class="indent">Dynamic measures of volume status, however, take into account fluctuations of the cardiopulmonary system across a period of time and have been shown to be more accurate for predicting fluid responsiveness (see <a href="ch015.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>). One increasingly popular dynamic measure that has been shown to be useful is <strong><em>pulse pressure variation (PPV)</em></strong>, the variation in pulse pressure with the respiratory cycle. PPV is easily obtained from an arterial blood pressure waveform, provided the patient is mechanically ventilated and in sinus rhythm (<strong><a href="#ff23-4">Figure 23.4</a></strong>). PPV is calculated as a percentage, as shown in <strong>Equation 23.6</strong>, with values &#x003E;12% over at least three respiratory cycles predictive of both hypovolemia and fluid responsiveness:</p>
<p class="u_equation"><img src="images/495-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="indent">Both PPV and the related measure of stroke volume variation (SVV) have been shown to be highly predictive of responsiveness to fluid resuscitation,<sup><a href="ch023-sec07.xhtml#bib11">11</a></sup> an important observation because up to 50% of hypovolemic patients may not respond to fluid resuscitation. That PPV and SVV may accurately identify those patients who will benefit from volume repletion makes them both valuable clinical tools.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen368">C. Oxygen Delivery as a Goal of Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The primary concern in the setting of depleted intravascular volume is impaired tissue oxygen delivery due to poor end-organ perfusion. If this impairment becomes severe enough, oxidative phosphorylation cannot occur, and tissues must rely on inefficient anaerobic respiration and simple glycolysis for energy production, ultimately resulting in end-organ dysfunction. Furthermore, prolonged impaired oxygen delivery is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The adequacy of oxygen delivery is determined by measuring markers of end-organ perfusion that act as a surrogate for effective circulating volume. Commonly utilized markers of the adequacy of global tissue perfusion as well as signs of organ dysfunction are listed in <strong><a href="#tt23-11">Table 23.11</a></strong>. Over the past decade, improvements in morbidity and mortality have been attributed to the adoption of early and aggressive therapy directed toward such markers, using an algorithmic approach with frequent reassessment.<sup><a href="ch023-sec07.xhtml#bib12">12</a>,<a href="ch023-sec07.xhtml#bib13">13</a></sup></p>
