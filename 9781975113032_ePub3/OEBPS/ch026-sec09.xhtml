<h4 class="h4" id="sec160">IX. Other Considerations and Complications</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen412">A. Tourniquet Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The use of a pneumatic tourniquet placed proximal to the surgical site and inflated to suprasystemic pressure minimizes blood loss and facilitates surgery by creating a bloodless field. Potential complications can be local, related to tissue pressure and ischemia, or systemic (<strong><a href="#tt26-11">Table 26.11</a></strong>). Extremity exsanguination prior to tourniquet inflation is performed by elevation of the limb or by compression with an elastic bandage to create a bloodless surgical field. Appropriate cuff sizing (cuff width 20% greater than limb diameter) and thorough padding help to reduce local tissue injury. Maximal duration of tourniquet time is not well defined, although 2 hours is generally considered safe to avoid distal tissue ischemia. If surgery duration requires extended tourniquet time, the tourniquet can be briefly deflated for 5 to 10 minutes before reinflation. The inflation pressure should not exceed 100&#x00A0;mm Hg above the systolic pressure for the upper extremity or above 150&#x00A0;mm Hg for the lower extremity. However, higher pressure may be needed in morbidly obese patients to prevent arterial inflow.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen413">B. Fat Embolus Syndrome</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Subclinical fat embolism is common with long bone fractures or major joint prostheses. When clinically significant, it manifests as <strong><em>fat embolism syndrome</em></strong> (FES), which is a potentially lethal condition. The prevailing pathogenesis theory of FES involves the increase in intramedullary pressure as a result of<a id="page563"></a> traumatic swelling, hematoma formation, or expansion with bone cement. When intramedullary pressure exceeds venous pressure, fat globules are forced into the venous circulation. Another theory suggests that fat globules are formed in the blood as a response to acute changes in fatty acid metabolism. Fat macroemboli can cause mechanical obstruction to pulmonary (and occasionally systemic) blood flow and damage capillary endothelium in the lungs and central nervous system. Major criteria for FES diagnosis include pulmonary manifestations (hypoxia, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome), neurologic impairment ranging from confusion or lethargy to seizures and coma, and petechia on the conjunctiva and upper trunk. Minor diagnostic criteria include fever, tachycardia, fat globules in sputum and urine, and decreased platelets and hematocrit. Early recognition is essential for therapeutic success. Treatment options include early fracture stabilization and aggressive cardiovascular and pulmonary supportive therapy.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen414">C. Methyl Methacrylate</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Polymethyl methacrylate</em></strong> is an acrylic bone cement used for securely binding prosthetic devices to bone during joint arthroplasties. Cement expansion during the hardening process may cause an increase in intramedullary pressure followed by systemic embolization of polymer, bone marrow, or air. Although volatile <strong><em>methylmethacrylate monomer</em></strong> can cause direct systemic toxic effects, the deleterious hemodynamic changes most likely result from embolism. Prevention includes surgical precautions such as creating vent holes or avoiding cement over pressurization as well as maintaining normovolemia.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The incidence of deep venous thrombosis after major orthopedic procedures can be as high as 60%, highlighting the importance of perioperative antithrombotic prophylaxis with mechanical, pharmacologic, or other techniques.</p>
</div>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen415">D. Venous Thromboembolism and Antithrombotic Prophylaxis</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The incidence of <strong><em>deep venous thrombosis</em></strong> can be as high as 60% after major orthopedic procedures if thromboprophylaxis is not used. Although often asymptomatic, it can lead to venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism. The incidence of venous thromboembolism is especially high after lower extremity fractures and joint replacements. Mechanical (sequential compression devices), pharmacologic, and ancillary (early mobilization) options can be employed for thromboprophylaxis. Pharmacologic methods include low-molecular-weight heparin, unfractionated heparin, or other anticoagulants such as fondaparinux or vitamin K inhibitors. Various evidence-based guidelines for <strong><em>thromboprophylaxis</em></strong> have been introduced by the American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons, the American College of Chest Physicians, and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence, most of which recommend a combination of pharmacologic and mechanical prophylaxis measures.<sup><a href="#bib18">18</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Prophylactic anticoagulation (eg, warfarin for atrial fibrillation) can interfere with regional anesthesia use for orthopedic surgery due to the potential risk of hematoma formation and permanent neurologic damage. Although the actual incidence of neurologic impairment as a result of this complication is unknown and likely low, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine has published evidence-based guidelines for regional anesthesia in patients receiving antithrombotic therapy.<sup><a href="#bib19">19</a></sup></p>
