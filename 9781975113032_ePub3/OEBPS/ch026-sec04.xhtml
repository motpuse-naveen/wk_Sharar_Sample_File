<h4 class="h4" id="sec155">IV. Anesthesia for Extremity Surgery</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Orthopedic extremity surgery is extremely common. It is performed for both elective and emergent indications and takes place in both inpatient and ambulatory outpatient settings. Furthermore, such surgery spans the age range from newborn (eg, congenital hip dysplasia) to the elderly (eg, traumatic hip fracture), as well as the spectrum of concurrent medical morbidities from the healthy professional athlete to a debilitated nursing facility resident. In addition, the following statements generally apply to anesthesia for extremity orthopedic surgery:</p>
<ul class="u_bullb"><li><span>Many orthopedic procedures can potentially use regional anesthesia techniques for intraoperative anesthesia, postoperative pain control, and joint rehabilitation.</span></li>
<li><span>Prevention of positioning-related complications, such as nerve and soft-tissue injuries, requires procedural knowledge and vigilance.</span></li>
<li><span>Significant blood loss can occur and requires familiarity with blood loss&#x2013;reducing techniques, such as tourniquet use, cell savers, and antifibrinolytics, transfusion triggers, and transfusion-related complications.</span></li>
<li><span>Prolonged immobilization following surgery, particularly involving the knee, hip, or pelvis, is associated with increased risk of deep venous thrombosis and thromboembolism. Conversely, thromboembolism prophylaxis may interfere with regional anesthesia techniques.</span></li></ul>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen405">A. Choice of Anesthetic Technique</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Many orthopedic surgical procedures are well suited for regional anesthesia, the general details of which are described in <a href="ch021.xhtml">Chapter 21</a>. Potential clinical benefits of regional anesthesia particular to orthopedic surgery include prolonged analgesia that reduces surgical stress, facilitates joint rehabilitation, and increases patient satisfaction. It can also decrease opioid analgesic use, postoperative nausea and vomiting, cognitive impairment, immunosuppression, and duration of recovery room stay. Thromboembolism reduction may occur with regional anesthesia and result from diminished sympathetic tone that enhances blood flow and prevents venous stasis. Risks of regional anesthesia include local anesthetic toxicity, hematoma formation, bleeding, nerve damage, and infection. With the introduction of ultrasound-guided techniques, both single-shot and indwelling catheter techniques (that enable prolonged analgesia and facilitate functional therapy) have become safe, efficient, and desirable anesthetic choices. Some patients may benefit from continued use of peripheral nerve catheters for 2 to 4&#x00A0;days after discharge, via single-use disposable local anesthetic infusion pumps that are lightweight, portable, and can be taken home.</p>
<p class="indent">Alternatively, general anesthesia can be used for virtually any orthopedic extremity procedure and may be required for prolonged procedures, those involving unique positioning, and those performed on the torso. In some cases, combined general and regional anesthesia may be indicated to achieve both <a id="page557"></a>ideal operative conditions and postoperative analgesia. The final choice of anesthetic technique should be tailored to the individual patient&#x2019;s needs based on specific medical conditions, comorbidities, age, type of surgery, and both the surgeon&#x2019;s and patient&#x2019;s preferences (<strong><a href="#tt26-8">Table 26.8</a></strong>).</p>
