<h4 class="h4" id="sec128">I. Anesthesia and Sedation: So Different Than Regular Sleep</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Many of us develop mild neuropathy or soft tissue injury when we sleep. We may awaken from sleep with tingling in the arm and hand due to ulnar nerve compression. The buttock soft tissues may be sore after awaking from prolonged sleep in a sitting position after a long air flight. Awakening allows us to reposition, reducing the tissue stretch and compression forces that caused our symptoms. Anesthesia and analgesics blunt the ability of patients to sense these symptoms and react by repositioning. Prolonged immobilization leads to the development of interstitial edema and inflammation in compressed tissue. These two factors exacerbate stretch and compression forces and, over time, may cause ischemia and more significant tissue damage.</p>
<p class="indent">Although most common, not all patient positioning problems involve mechanical forces on tissues. Some of the most catastrophic positioning injuries occur during procedures that require positions other than supine. For instance, the head elevated, &#x201C;beach chair&#x201D; position required for some shoulder or neurosurgical procedures may cause decreased brain perfusion, leading to stroke. Procedures performed in the prone positioning are associated with an increased risk of postoperative vision loss due to ischemic optic neuropathy, which may be caused by venous congestion in the optic canal. The lithotomy position is associated with the highest incidence of positioning-related lower extremity nerve injuries. Common peroneal injury may be caused by compression where the nerve wraps around the fibula; stretch-related sciatic nerve injury may be caused by excessive hip extension. Less commonly, venous engorgement of the lower extremities may cause hypoxic tissue damage and clinical compartment syndrome.</p>

<p class="dify">Based on data from the Anesthesia Closed Claims Project, peripheral nerve injury claims represent approximately 12% of claims since 1990.<sup><a href="ch022-sec06.xhtml#bib1">1</a></sup></p>

<p class="indent">Perioperative positioning problems have not been well studied, and etiologic factors are not well defined. Although some etiologies are clear (eg, direct compression of a stoma in a prone-positioned patient that causes ischemia to<a id="page464"></a> the externalized stomal tissues), others are not as evident (<strong><a href="#ff22-1">Figure 22.1</a></strong>). Most patients who develop perioperative ulnar neuropathy do not become symptomatic until 2 to 5&#x00A0;days after their procedures.<sup><a href="ch022-sec06.xhtml#bib2">2</a></sup> However, direct compression to nerves should cause immediate ischemia and symptoms of neuropathy. Thus, it appears that factors beyond intraoperative positioning may be at play. Recent evidence indicates that many patients with new-onset ulnar neuropathy have systemic lymphatic microvasculitis of their peripheral nerves, which is treatable with corticosteroids.<sup><a href="ch022-sec06.xhtml#bib3">3</a></sup> These findings suggest that the perioperative inflammatory response associated with most surgical procedures may be a factor in the development of injuries formerly attributed to pressure-related positioning injury. This chapter explains the mechanisms common to perioperative soft tissue injuries.</p>
