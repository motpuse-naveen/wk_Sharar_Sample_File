<h4 class="h4" id="sec219">III. Intraoperative Management</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen602">A. Drug Pharmacology and Aging</h5>
<p class="nonindent">With increasing age, lean body mass decreases and body fat percentage increases (<strong><a href="#ff34-8">Figure 34.8</a></strong>). Consequently, the volume of distribution for lipid-soluble drugs increases. Also, renal clearance decreases with age. These changes increase the half-lives or the context-sensitive half-times of many drugs.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib20">20</a></sup> In general, smaller doses are needed in comparison with young adults. In addition, more time should be allowed for the drug to achieve its peak target organ (brain) effect. For example, propofol dosing should probably be decreased by around 50% in older adults and is best titrated to effect.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen603">B. Choice of Anesthetic Technique</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Large clinical studies and several meta-analyses have not found an advantage to regional versus general anesthesia in older adults. In a meta-analysis of 21 studies involving patients older than 50 years who underwent major surgery (cardiac and noncardiac) and were cognitively normal at baseline, the incidence of postoperative delirium was not different between those who received general or regional anesthesia.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib21">21</a></sup> Although regional anesthesia techniques probably provide the most effective analgesia (at least for the duration of the block), most studies suggest that this does not translate into improved long-term outcomes.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib22">22</a></sup> Hip fractures carry ominous in-hospital and 30-day mortalities (roughly 5%-10%) with high rates of cardiovascular and pulmonary complications and substantial postoperative disability. With an estimated annual incidence of more than 1.5 million cases worldwide, any potential improvement for this vulnerable group would have far-reaching social and economic implications. A retrospective analysis of a large cohort of patients undergoing hip fracture repair found a small difference in length of stay favoring regional over general anesthesia; however, there was no difference in mortality.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib23">23</a></sup></p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen604">C. Blood Pressure Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Induction of anesthesia in older adults is often accompanied by hypotension, and prolonged hypotension is associated with adverse outcomes.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib24">24</a></sup> While it is unclear whether the association between hypotension and adverse outcomes is causal, it is hypothesized that avoidance of hypotension may help mitigate risk. Many strategies can be used to minimize hypotension during anesthesia.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib25">25</a></sup> One strategy focuses on the choice and dose of induction agents (eg, reduction in the propofol dose and use of adjuncts such as opioids, ketamine, or etomidate). Another option is to use vasopressors prophylactically (eg, treat anticipated hypotension with phenylephrine). Intraoperative blood pressure goals in older adults should probably be higher than younger adults due to the high incidence of baseline hypertension, especially in patients with significant arterial disease.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib26">26</a></sup> However, an excessive hypertensive response to intubation can be harmful to the older heart; thus, care must be taken to dose induction agents adequately. Ultimately, the goal is hemodynamic stability with minimal swings in blood pressure.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen605">D. Fluids and Transfusion Management</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Older adults are susceptible to impaired fluid management and electrolyte abnormalities. Ideally, intraoperative fluid and transfusion management strategies should optimize oxygen delivery and organ perfusion. Unfortunately, clinical signs of intravascular volume status are often difficult to evaluate in older persons, and it can be challenging to maintain intraoperative euvolemia.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib27">27</a></sup> <a id="page740"></a>While small trials have suggested that using various monitoring modalities to guide administration of intravenous fluid and inotropic drugs could improve postoperative outcomes,<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib28">28</a></sup> a large, pragmatic trial did not.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib29">29</a></sup> A limited subgroup of patients may benefit from advanced hemodynamic monitoring, but how to identify this subgroup has yet to be established.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib30">30</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Transfusion management in older adults is also a matter of debate. Some advocate a liberal transfusion threshold (maintaining a hemoglobin concentration above 9-10&#x00A0;g/dL), while others support a restrictive threshold (above 7-8&#x00A0;g/dL).<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib31">31</a></sup> Proponents of a liberal strategy suggest that anemia is associated with reduced delivery of oxygen to the tissues and poorer outcomes. Proponents of the restrictive strategy suggest that aggressive correction of anemia with red blood cell transfusions is associated with other adverse outcomes (eg, increased risk of infection and fluid overload). The approach chosen must also consider the patient&#x2019;s preexisting conditions, such as cardiovascular disease.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen606">E. Thermoregulation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Age is an independent risk factor for the development of hypothermia during anesthesia. Hypothermia is common not only during general anesthesia, but also during regional anesthesia. Thermoregulatory responses are blunted in the elderly. This is mostly due to altered regulation of skin blood flow, which leads to a reduction in the threshold for thermoregulatory vasoconstriction. Clinical signs such as shivering are reduced or absent in older patients, and rewarming takes significantly longer than in younger adults. Maintenance of normothermia is important, since hypothermia increases the risk for myocardial ischemia, surgical wound infection, coagulopathy, and impaired drug metabolism.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib32">32</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The initial decrease in core temperature during anesthesia results from the redistribution of heat to the periphery. Prewarming in the preoperative area helps minimize this redistribution of core heat. Active warming in the cold environment of the operating room as well as temperature monitoring are advised, especially during long surgeries.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen607">F. Mechanical Ventilation</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Postoperative pulmonary complications are common. If positive-pressure ventilation is utilized in the operating room, an important goal is to have lung volume exceed closing capacity during the respiratory cycle to prevent atelectasis. A ventilation strategy of modest tidal volumes (6-8&#x00A0;mL/kg) with individualized positive end-expiratory pressure between 5 and 8&#x00A0;cm&#x00A0;H<sub>2</sub>O, as well as repeated recruitment maneuvers has been suggested to decrease the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. In addition, use of routine monitoring to avoid hyperoxia and monitoring of neuromuscular blockade to minimize the risk of residual paralysis are advised.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib33">33</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen608">G. Delirium Prevention</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Multiple studies have investigated the prophylactic use of medications for the prevention of delirium. While small, single-center studies using medications such as ketamine or dexmedetomidine initially showed promise, larger multicenter studies have not replicated these results.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib34">34</a>,<a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib35">35</a></sup> Similarly, depth of anesthesia monitoring using processed electroencephalogram also has not been found to be beneficial.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib36">36</a></sup> Single-center studies found evidence of benefit in specific high-risk populations, but a pragmatic trial in which patients undergoing major surgery were randomized to usual care versus electroencephalographic measurement to prevent burst suppression found no difference in the rates of postoperative delirium.<sup><a href="ch034-sec05.xhtml#bib37">37</a></sup></p>
