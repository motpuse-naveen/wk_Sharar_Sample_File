<h4 class="h4" id="sec12">V. Ventilation</h4>
<p class="nonindent">Arguably, the central function of the pulmonary system is oxygen and carbon dioxide gas exchange. Ventilation, movement of gas in and out of the lungs, is essential for continued exchange to occur at the level of the alveolus and pulmonary capillary membrane. Respiratory centers in the brain normally control ventilation. As anesthetic management often alters normal ventilation, a thorough understanding of ventilatory physiology is essential to the practice of anesthesiology and critical care medicine.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen25">A. Respiratory Centers</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Basal ventilation is controlled by respiratory centers located in the brain stem, particularly the medulla and the pons. They process an array of information to determine a ventilation rate and pattern and can function independent of an intact cerebrum.<sup><a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The medulla oblongata contains the most basic ventilation control centers, the dorsal respiratory group (DRG) and the ventral respiratory group (VRG). The DRG provides for a ventilation rate by rhythmically stimulating inspiration. The VRG, conversely, coordinates exhalation. The DRG stimulates inspiration, which is followed by a signal by the VRG to extinguish the stimulation from the DRG, halting active inspiratory effort and allowing for passive exhalation. Without the VRG, DRG activity results in an irregular breathing pattern characterized by maximum inspiratory efforts and bouts of apnea. In this manner, the DRG and VRG work in combination, resulting in rhythmic ventilation.</p>
<a id="page18"></a>
<p class="indent">The pontine respiratory centers, the apneustic center and the pneumotaxic respiratory center, communicate with respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata to alter the ventilation pattern and rate. The apneustic center sends signals to the DRG to prolong inspiration, whereas the pneumotaxic center functions to limit inspiration. With increased stimulation, the pneumotaxic center will also increase the ventilatory rate in addition to decreasing inspiratory volume. In this fashion, the pontine respiratory centers can alter ventilation.</p>
<p class="indent">Respiratory centers in the medulla and pons are the primary centers of ventilation control. However, the midbrain and cerebral cortex may also affect the ventilatory pattern. For example, the reticular activating system in the midbrain increases rate and volume of inspiration with activation. Reflexes can also alter ventilation. Both the swallowing and vomiting reflex result in a cessation of inspiration to avoid aspiration. The cough reflex is stimulated by irritation of the trachea and requires a deep inspiration followed by a forced exhalation against momentarily closed vocal cords to create an expulsive maneuver to be effective at clearing irritants and secretions. Smooth muscle spindles in the airways of lungs likely react to pressure changes from pulmonary edema or atelectasis, providing proprioception for the lung and resulting in ventilatory alterations. Golgi tendon organs, tendon spindles primarily located in intercostal muscles, are stimulated when stretched, inhibiting further inspiration. The Hering-Breuer reflex, although weakly present in humans, may also alter ventilation by inhibiting inspiration during lung distention. In this manner, reflexes and higher brain centers affect ventilation patterns established by respiratory centers in the brain stem.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen26">B. Chemical Ventilatory Control</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The respiratory centers regulate ventilation based on the relative chemical content of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Central and peripheral chemoreceptors provide chemical environmental data to the respiratory centers.<sup><a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib7">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Central chemoreceptors are located in the medulla and relay information on ventilation needs based on pH. Despite not being directly sensed, carbon dioxide has a potent effect on central chemoreceptors by conversion to hydrogen ions altering the pH:</p>
<p class="eq"><img src="images/18-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="indent">As carbon dioxide readily passes the blood-brain barrier, it is converted into hydrogen ions, stimulating the central chemoreceptors in the medulla. The response to elevations in carbon dioxide is rapid, resulting in increases in tidal volume and ventilation rate within 1 to 2 minutes. Over several hours, the response to sustained elevations in carbon dioxide diminishes as bicarbonate ions are likely transported into the cerebrospinal fluid, neutralizing the stimulating hydrogen ions formed by elevated carbon dioxide levels. The ability of the cerebrospinal fluid to alter and neutralize its hydrogen ions over time explains the respiratory center&#x2019;s response to chronic versus acute elevations in carbon dioxide levels. Of note, central chemoreceptors will also decrease ventilation secondary to hypothermia, but most importantly, they respond to changes in hydrogen ion concentrations secondary to carbon dioxide concentrations.</p>
<a id="page19"></a>
<p class="indent">Carotid body chemoreceptors deliver signals to the respiratory centers based on oxygen and carbon dioxide content from the periphery. These peripheral chemoreceptors are found at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery and communicate to the respiratory centers via the afferent glossopharyngeal nerve. Carotid body chemoreceptors also deliver signals of acidosis, both from metabolic and elevated carbon dioxide causes, although signals of increased acidosis from peripheral chemoreceptors have minimal effects on ventilation. Aortic body chemoreceptors found around the aortic arch also deliver signals regarding partial pressure of oxygen via the vagus nerve. This signal leads primarily to changes in circulation with minimal effects on ventilation.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Signaling to the respiratory centers is initiated at arterial partial pressure of oxygen (Pa<small>O</small><sub>2</sub>) &#x003C;100&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg, but ventilation is not altered until oxygen partial pressure falls below 65&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg, at which point tidal volume and ventilation rate are increased.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Breath holding and the ventilatory response to altitude aptly illustrate chemoreceptor signal integration by respiratory centers. Knowing that central carbon dioxide&#x2013;sensing chemoreceptors override peripheral oxygen-sensing chemoreceptors aids in understanding the process of chemoreceptor ventilatory control. With significant altitude elevation, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (Pa<small>O</small><sub>2</sub>) decreases, thereby stimulating the peripheral carotid body chemoreceptor to acutely increase ventilation. The increased ventilation in turn lowers carbon dioxide levels, decreasing the hydrogen ion concentration, resulting in inhibition of ventilation from the central chemoreceptors. The increased signal from the peripheral chemoreceptors coupled with the decreased drive from the central chemoreceptors results in a new equilibrium. These changes cause increased ventilation but continued hypoxemia, likely the cause of the headache associated with altitude sickness. With time, renal compensation allows bicarbonate ions to be removed from the cerebrospinal fluid to normalize hydrogen ion concentration. The normalization removes inhibition of ventilation from the central chemoreceptors, allowing the respiratory centers to comply with the ventilatory signal transmitted by the peripheral chemoreceptors responding to hypoxemia. Mountain climbers routinely practice acclimatization to allow chemoreceptors to function with physiologically appropriate outcomes.</p>

<p class="dify">Peripheral carotid body chemoreceptors respond primarily to lack of oxygen, while central chemoreceptors react to elevations in carbon dioxide.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Breath holding, a common childhood game, also clearly demonstrates chemoreceptor ventilatory physiology. The combination of stimulating signals from the central chemoreceptors, at arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub>) of 50&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg and peripheral chemoreceptors at Pa<small>O</small><sub>2</sub> of 65&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg, compels adults to breathe. With breath holding, the Pa<small>O</small><sub>2</sub> decreases to approximately 65&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg within 1 minute, while the Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub> increases 12&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg in the first minute and then 6&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg per minute thereafter.<sup><a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib8">8</a></sup> Most adults can hold their breath for a minute, reaching Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub> levels of 65&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg and Pa<small>O</small><sub>2</sub> levels of 50&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg. If one inhales supplemental oxygen, minimizing ventilatory signals from the peripheral chemoreceptors, ventilation does not occur until Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub> levels reach 60&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg or in 2 to 3 minutes. Hyperventilation with supplemental oxygen can depress Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub> to 20&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg, allowing breath holding to continue for approximately 5 minutes. Notably, hyperventilation without supplemental oxygen can be deleterious and result in unconsciousness as the hypoxemic ventilatory drive from peripheral oxygen-sensing chemoreceptor is outweighed by central carbon dioxide&#x2013;sensing chemoreceptors. Thus, hyperventilating room air prior to a prolonged underwater swim is highly inadvisable!</p>
<p class="indent">Graphic representation of carbon dioxide and oxygen response curves allows for quantitative understanding of ventilation control. The Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub> and Pa<small>O</small><sub>2</sub> ventilation response curves represent resultant ventilation at different levels of Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub> and Pa<small>O</small><sub>2</sub>, respectively. The Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub> ventilation response curve is fairly linear in the normal range (<strong><a href="#ff2-3">Figure 2.3</a></strong>). The change in ventilatory<a id="page20"></a> response increases at Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub> &#x003E; 80&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg, resulting in a parabolic graph, and peaks at about 100&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg, the point at which carbon dioxide becomes a ventilatory depressant. The Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub> response curve may be shifted left with arterial hypoxemia, the peripheral chemoreceptor response, metabolic acidosis, or a central nervous system etiology. The left shift will result in an increase in minute ventilation at constant Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub> levels. The response to Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub> may be decreased with opioids or barbiturates, which act as ventilatory depressants, shifting the response curve to the right. Opioids result in decreased minute ventilation with decreased respiratory rates and increased tidal volumes, while barbiturates and inhaled anesthetics initially result in increased ventilatory rates with decreased tidal volumes. Continued administration of barbiturates or inhalational anesthetics will eventually depress the ventilatory response to Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub>, resulting in a flatter curve.</p>

<p class="dify">With Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub> levels &#x003E;80&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg, CO<sub>2</sub> acts as a ventilatory depressant and hypnotic.</p>

<p class="indent">The Pa<small>O</small><sub>2</sub> ventilation response curve depends on the concurrent Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub> level.<sup><a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib9">9</a></sup> Holding Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub> levels constant illustrates the sole effect of Pa<small>O</small><sub>2</sub> on ventilation (<strong><a href="#ff2-4">Figure 2.4</a></strong>). At normocarbic levels, peripheral chemoreceptors will stimulate ventilation at levels of Pa<small>O</small><sub>2</sub> below 65&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg. With hypercarbia, the signals from peripheral chemoreceptors lead to increased ventilation only when Pa<small>O</small><sub>2</sub> levels are below 100&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg, the level at which peripheral chemoreceptors begin to send impulses to the respiratory centers. Normally, however, as humans increase ventilation, Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub> levels decrease. As Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub> levels decrease, the ventilatory impulse from central chemoreceptors is decreased to the point where ventilation signals from the peripheral chemoreceptors are muffled, leading to a decreased ventilatory response. This phenomenon results in depressed oxygen-mediated ventilatory response compared to situations where Pa<small>CO</small><sub>2</sub> levels are normal.</p>

<p class="indent">Oxygen at supratherapeutic levels may be detrimental. In patients who depend on peripheral chemoreceptors for hypoxic ventilatory drive (of which there are very few), Pa<small>O</small><sub>2</sub> &#x003E; 65&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg will likely suppress ventilation and result in hypercarbia. Supratherapeutic oxygen delivery may also lead to free radical injury, resulting in acute lung injury.</p>
<p class="indent">A low level of carbon dioxide leads to suppression of ventilatory drive, cerebral vasoconstriction, and lowered plasma calcium ion concentration secondary to alkalosis. Conversely, elevated carbon dioxide may result in increased sympathetic output, causing tachycardia and hypertension, and will independently cause cerebral vasodilation. Elevated carbon dioxide can also act to cause disorientation with further increases leading to unconsciousness. Thus, the respiratory centers rely on impulse generation from chemoreceptors to maintain carbon dioxide and oxygen at physiologic levels.</p>
