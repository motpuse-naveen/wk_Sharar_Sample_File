<p class="nonindent">Sevoflurane can be degraded to vinyl ether, also called <strong><em>Compound A</em></strong>, by the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) absorbent in the anesthesia breathing circuit. The production of Compound A is enhanced when the total flow of oxygen or nitrous oxide is low, during use of a closed-circuit breathing system, and when the CO<sub>2</sub> absorbent is warm or very dry. Compound A is toxic to the renal system of animals; however, there has been no evidence of renal toxicity with sevoflurane usage in humans. <strong><a href="#ff8-7">Figure 8.7</a></strong> shows the extent to which Compound A is produced with various CO<sub>2</sub> absorbents.</p>
<p class="indent">Desflurane can be degraded to carbon monoxide by CO<sub>2</sub> absorbents. This is most likely when the absorbent is new or dry (water content &#x003C;5%) and when the absorbent contains barium.</p>

<p class="indent">All the modern volatile anesthetics contain fluoride. This was a problem for older anesthetics, such as methoxyflurane, because metabolism of the drug to a free fluoride ion caused renal toxicity. However, the newer anesthetics undergo limited metabolism, and fluoride-induced renal toxicity has not been demonstrated.</p>

<p class="dify">Inhaled anesthetics and nitrous oxide are greenhouse gases. Nitrous oxide is also destructive to the ozone layer. The global warming potential (GWP) of desflurane is the highest, followed by isoflurane. Sevoflurane has the least GWP. Xenon has none.</p>
