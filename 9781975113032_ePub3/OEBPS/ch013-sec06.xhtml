<h4 class="h4" id="sec83">VI. Antihypertensive Medications</h4>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen197">A. <strong><em>&#x03B2;</em></strong>-Blockers</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Many of the cardiovascular actions of <em>&#x03B2;</em>-adrenoceptor antagonists (&#x201C;<em>&#x03B2;</em>-blockers&#x201D;) may be anticipated based on the previous discussion of catecholamines (<strong><a href="#tt13-3">Table 13.3</a></strong>). <em>&#x03B2;</em>-blockers produce important anti-ischemic effects and are considered a first-line therapy for treatment of patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction in the absence of cardiogenic shock, hemodynamically significant bradyarrhythmias, or reactive airway disease. Indeed, <em>&#x03B2;</em>-blockers have been repeatedly shown to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with myocardial infarction in a number of large clinical trials. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend continuation of <em>&#x03B2;</em>-blockers in patients who are receiving them chronically for established cardiac indications. <em>&#x03B2;</em>-blockers should be considered for patients undergoing vascular surgery and those at high risk of myocardial ischemia who are schedule to undergo intermediate- or high-risk noncardiac surgery. Perioperative <em>&#x03B2;</em>-blocker therapy should be initiated well before anticipated elective surgery to mitigate the elevated risk of severe stroke and death that was reported when a large dose of one of these drugs (metoprolol) was first administered on the day of surgery. <em>&#x03B2;</em>-blockers are effective for the treatment of essential hypertension and also exert useful antiarrhythmic effects, especially in the presence of increased sympathetic nervous system tone associated with surgery or during conditions characterized by elevated levels of circulating catecholamines (eg, pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism). <em>&#x03B2;</em>-blockers reduce heart rate, myocardial contractility, and arterial pressure by binding to <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors and inhibiting the actions of circulating catecholamines and norepinephrine released from postganglionic sympathetic nerves. The decrease in heart rate produced by <em>&#x03B2;</em>-blockers prolongs diastole, increases coronary blood flow to the LV, enhances coronary collateral perfusion to ischemic myocardium, and improves oxygen delivery to the coronary microcirculation. These combined effects serve to reduce myocardial oxygen demand while simultaneously increasing supply. <em>&#x03B2;</em>-blockers have also been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation. This latter action is particularly important during acute myocardial ischemia or evolving myocardial infarction because platelet aggregation at the site of an atherosclerotic plaque may worsen a coronary stenosis or produce acute occlusion of the vessel. <em>&#x03B2;</em>-blockers vary in their affinity for and relative selectivity at the <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor, while some of these drugs exert &#x201C;intrinsic sympathetic activity&#x201D; by acting as partial <em>&#x03B2;</em>-adrenoceptor agonists. Nevertheless, all <em>&#x03B2;</em>-blockers effectively reduce arterial pressure.</p>

<h6 class="h6">Esmolol</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Esmolol is a relatively selective <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor blocker. The chemical structure of esmolol is very similar to that of propranolol and metoprolol, but esmolol contains an additional methylester group that facilitates the drug&#x2019;s rapid metabolism via hydrolysis by red blood cell esterases, resulting in an elimination half-life of approximately 9&#x00A0;minutes. The rapid onset and metabolism of esmolol makes the drug very useful for the treatment of acute tachycardia and hypertension during surgery. Esmolol is most often administered as an intravenous bolus, which causes almost immediate dose-related decreases in heart rate and myocardial contractility; arterial pressure declines as a result of these direct negative chronotropic and inotropic effects. Esmolol is often used to attenuate the sympathetic nervous system response to laryngoscopy, endotracheal intubation, or surgical stimulation, particularly in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease who may be at risk of myocardial ischemia. Esmolol is also useful for rapid control of heart rate in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (eg, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter). Esmolol effectively blunts the sympathetically mediated tachycardia and hypertension that occur shortly after the onset of seizure activity during electroconvulsive therapy. Because esmolol does not appreciably block <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors due to its relative <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-selectivity, hypotension is more commonly observed after administration of this drug compared with other nonselective <em>&#x03B2;</em>-blockers.</p>

</div>
<h6 class="h6">Labetalol</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Labetalol is composed of four stereoisomers that inhibit <em>&#x03B1;</em>- and <em>&#x03B2;</em>-adrenoceptors to varying degrees. One of the four stereoisomers is an <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonist, another is a nonselective <em>&#x03B2;</em>-adrenoceptor blocker, and the remaining two do not appreciably affect adrenergic receptors. The net effect of this mixture is a drug that selectively inhibits <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors while simultaneously blocking <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>- and <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors in a nonselective manner. The intravenous formulation of labetalol contains a ratio of <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>- to <em>&#x03B2;</em>-adrenoceptor blockade of approximately 1:7. Blockade of the <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor causes arteriolar vasodilation and decreases arterial pressure through a reduction in systemic vascular resistance. This property makes the drug very useful for the treatment of perioperative hypertension. Despite its nonselective <em>&#x03B2;</em>-blocking properties, labetalol is also a partial <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist; this latter characteristic also contributes to vasodilation. Labetalol-induced inhibition of <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors decreases heart rate and myocardial contractility. Stroke volume and cardiac output are essentially unchanged as a result of the combined actions of labetalol on <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>- and <em>&#x03B2;</em>-adrenoceptors. Unlike other vasodilators, labetalol produces vasodilation without triggering baroreceptor reflex tachycardia because the drug blocks expected increases in heart rate mediated through <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors. This latter action may be especially beneficial for the treatment of hypertension in <a id="page280"></a>the setting of acute myocardial ischemia. Labetalol is most commonly used for the treatment of perioperative hypertension. Labetalol may also be useful for controlling arterial pressure without producing tachycardia in patients with hypertensive emergencies and those with acute type A aortic dissection. Labetalol has been shown to attenuate the sympathetic nervous system response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation, although the drug&#x2019;s relatively long elimination half-life (approximately 6 hours) limits its utility in this setting.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen198">B. Nitrovasodilators</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Nitrovasodilators include organic nitrates (eg, nitroglycerin) and nitric oxide (NO) donors (eg, sodium nitroprusside) that release NO through enzymatic sulfhydryl group reduction or through a spontaneous mechanism that occurs independent of metabolism, respectively. Like endogenous NO produced by vascular endothelium, exogenous NO stimulates guanylate cyclase within the vascular smooth muscle cell to convert guanosine triphosphate to cGMP. The second messenger activates a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase G) that dephosphorylates myosin light chains and contributes to relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. NO stimulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by activating the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase through a cGMP-independent mechanism, thereby reducing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and causing relaxation. NO also stimulates potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) efflux from the cell by activating the K<sup>+</sup> channel. The net effect of this shift in K<sup>+</sup> balance is cellular hyperpolarization, which closes the sarcolemmal voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel and also facilitates relaxation.</p>
<p class="indent">Nitrovasodilators are often used to improve hemodynamics and myocardial oxygen supply&#x2013;demand relations in patients with heart failure. Vasodilation reduces venous return, contributing to declines in LV and RV end-diastolic volume, pressure, and wall stress, and also reduces systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, which decreases LV and RV end-systolic wall stress, respectively. These actions combine to decrease myocardial oxygen consumption. Simultaneously, nitrovasodilators increase myocardial oxygen supply through direct dilation of epicardial coronary arteries in the absence and presence of flow-limiting stenoses. The reduction in LV end-diastolic pressure observed during administration of nitrovasodilators coupled with coronary vasodilation substantially enhances subendocardial perfusion. The clinical efficacy of nitrovasodilators may display some initial variability between patients, but the cardiovascular effects of these drugs inevitably diminish with prolonged use. Some patients may be relatively resistant to the effects of organic nitrates in the presence of oxidative stress because superoxide anions scavenge NO, cause reversible oxidation of guanylate cyclase, and inhibit aldehyde dehydrogenase. The latter action prevents the release of NO from organic nitrates. A progressive attenuation of hemodynamic responses to nitrovasodilators may develop in other patients as a result of sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis activation; this phenomenon (&#x201C;pseudo-tolerance&#x201D;) accounts for the rebound hypertension that may be observed after abrupt discontinuation of nitrovasodilator therapy. Inhibition of guanylate cyclase activity is most likely responsible for true tolerance to organic nitrates. A &#x201C;drug holiday&#x201D; is a useful strategy for reversing this effect in patients requiring prolonged treatment in the intensive care unit. Administration of <em>N</em>-acetylcysteine, a sulfhydryl donor, may also be effective for reversing true tolerance. Notably, prolonged use of organic nitrates may also cause<a id="page281"></a> methemoglobinemia, interfere with platelet aggregation, and produce heparin resistance. It is also important to recognize that organic nitrates should also be used with caution in patients receiving phosphodiesterase type V inhibitors (eg, sildenafil) because NO-induced vasodilation is enhanced and profound hypotension, myocardial ischemia or infarction, and death may result.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Nitroglycerin</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nitroglycerin dilates venules to a greater degree than arterioles. At lower doses, the organic nitrate produces venodilation without causing a significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Arterial pressure and cardiac output fall in response to the reduction in preload despite a modest baroreceptor reflex&#x2013;mediated increase in heart rate. Nitroglycerin also decreases pulmonary arterial pressures and vascular resistance. At higher doses, nitroglycerin dilates arterioles, reducing LV afterload, causing more pronounced decreases in arterial pressure, and stimulating greater reflex tachycardia. Overshoot hypotension and tachycardia is particularly common setting of hypovolemia, such as is often observed in patients with poorly controlled essential hypertension and parturients with pregnancy-induced hypertension.</p>
<p class="indent">Nitroglycerin improves the balance of myocardial oxygen supply to demand through its actions as a direct coronary vasodilator (which increase supply) and its systemic hemodynamic effects (which reduce demand). Nitroglycerin dilates both normal and poststenotic epicardial coronary arteries, enhances blood flow through coronary collateral vessels, and preferentially improves subendocardial perfusion. The drug also inhibits coronary vasospasm and dilates arterial conduits used during CABG surgery. Nitroglycerin decreases myocardial oxygen demand by reducing LV preload, and to a lesser extent afterload, thereby producing corresponding reductions in LV end-diastolic and end-systolic wall stress. These effects are particularly important in patients with acutely decompensated heart failure resulting from myocardial ischemia. Thus, nitroglycerin is a very effective first-line drug for the treatment of myocardial ischemia, but caution should be exercised when using nitroglycerin in patients with ischemia who are also hypovolemic. Under these circumstances, administration of nitroglycerin may precipitate life-threatening hypotension by compromising coronary perfusion pressure, reducing coronary blood flow despite epicardial vasodilation, and worsening ischemia.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Sodium Nitroprusside</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Sodium nitroprusside is an ultrashort-acting direct NO donor. It is a potent venous and arterial vasodilator devoid of inotropic effects that rapidly reduces arterial pressure by decreasing LV preload and afterload. These characteristics make sodium nitroprusside a first-line drug for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies. Sodium nitroprusside is also useful for the treatment of cardiogenic shock because arterial vasodilation improves forward flow by reducing impedance to LV ejection, while venodilation decreases LV filling pressures. Unlike nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside is relatively contraindicated in patients with acute myocardial ischemia because the drug causes abnormal redistribution of coronary blood flow away from ischemic myocardium (&#x201C;coronary steal&#x201D;) by producing greater coronary vasodilation in vessels that perfuse normal myocardium compared with those that supply the ischemic territory. Baroreceptor reflex&#x2013;mediated tachycardia is also more pronounced during administration of sodium nitroprusside compared with nitroglycerin because the direct NO donor is a more potent arteriolar vasodilator than the<a id="page282"></a> organic nitrate. This reflex tachycardia dramatically increases heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand, thereby exacerbating acute myocardial ischemia. Sodium nitroprusside is often combined with a <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonist such as esmolol to decrease arterial pressure, depress myocardial contractility, and reduce ascending aortic wall stress in patients with acute type A aortic dissection until direct surgical control of the injury can be achieved. Clinical use of sodium nitroprusside is limited by its toxic metabolites, which predictably accumulate when administration is prolonged or relatively high doses are used. Metabolism of sodium nitroprusside produces cyanide, which binds with cytochrome C to inhibit aerobic metabolism and cause lactic acidosis. Cyanide derived from sodium nitroprusside metabolism also binds with hemoglobin to form methemoglobin and with sulfur to form thiocyanate. The latter metabolite may accumulate in patients with renal insufficiency and produce neurological complications including delirium and seizures.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen199">C. Hydralazine</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Hydralazine is a direct vasodilator that reduces intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in vascular smooth muscle, at least in part, by activating ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels. This action produces direct relaxation of small arteries and arterioles in coronary, cerebral, splanchnic, and renal vascular beds, declines in systemic vascular resistance, and decreases in arterial pressure. LV preload is relatively preserved because hydralazine does not dilate venous capacitance vessels. The primary reduction in afterload stimulates baroreceptor reflex&#x2013;mediated tachycardia and increases cardiac output. The magnitude of tachycardia observed with administration of hydralazine is often greater than expected based solely on baroreceptor reflexes alone and may instead reflect a direct effect of the drug on other centrally mediated cardiovascular regulatory mechanisms. The pronounced tachycardia associated with administration of hydralazine may produce acute myocardial ischemia in patients with critical coronary stenoses based on increases in myocardial oxygen demand and reductions in coronary perfusion pressure. Hydralazine-induced tachycardia responds appropriately to <em>&#x03B2;</em><sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonists, but caution should be exercised because further declines in arterial pressure may also occur. Hydralazine is commonly used for management of sustained postoperative hypertension in the absence of tachycardia.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen200">D. Calcium Channel Antagonists</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Calcium channels are asymmetric biochemical pores consisting of at least four subunits (<em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>&#x03B1;</em><sub>2</sub>/<em>&#x03B4;</em>, and <em>&#x03B2;</em> with or without <em>&#x03B3;</em>) that traverse many biological membranes. Under quiescent conditions, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are closed, but they may open through a voltage-dependent (requiring cell depolarization) or receptor-operated (activation) mechanism to allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the cell or an organelle (eg, mitochondria, sarcoplasmic reticulum), most often down an electrochemical gradient. Myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes contain two distinct types of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels that are denoted based on the relative duration of pore opening: T (transient) and L (long). The L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel is the predominant target of all Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel antagonists in current clinical use (these drugs do not block the T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel). There are four major classes of chemically distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel antagonists (<strong><a href="#tt13-4">Table 13.4</a></strong>): (1) 1,4-dihydropyridines (eg, nifedipine, nicardipine, clevidipine), (2) benzothiazepines (diltiazem), (3) phenylalkylamines (verapamil), and (4) diarylaminopropylamine ethers (bepridil). In general, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel antagonists produce vasodilation, direct negative chronotropic, dromotropic, and inotropic effects and baroreceptor reflex&#x2013;mediated increases in heart rate to varying degrees depending on each drug&#x2019;s relative selectivity for voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in myocardium and vascular smooth muscle. All Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel antagonists cause greater relaxation of arterial compared with venous vascular smooth muscle. This action reduces LV afterload while preserving preload. Calcium channel antagonists improve myocardial oxygen supply through coronary arterial vasodilation and inhibition of coronary artery vasospasm. In addition to eliciting declines in LV afterload, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel antagonists such as diltiazem and verapamil may also reduce myocardial oxygen demand via depression of myocardial contractility and decreases in heart rate mediated by reduced sinoatrial node automaticity and AV node conduction. However, it is important to note that some dihydropyridine Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel antagonists may inadvertently increase myocardial oxygen demand as a result of baroreceptor reflex&#x2013;induced tachycardia and, as a result, may not consistently produce anti-ischemic effects in patients with coronary artery disease. For the sake of brevity, the authors will confine their discussion to two intravenous dihydropyridines that are commonly used for the treatment of perioperative hypertension.</p>

<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">All Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers produce greater relaxation of arterial than venous vascular smooth muscle.</p>
</div>
<h6 class="h6">Nicardipine</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Nicardipine is a dihydropyridine Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel antagonist that is highly selective for vascular smooth muscle. Nicardipine produces cardiovascular effects that are similar to nifedipine, but has a longer half-life than the latter drug. Nicardipine is a profound vasodilator because of its pronounced inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in vascular smooth muscle. Like other dihydropyridine Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel antagonists, nicardipine preferentially dilates arteriolar vessels; this effect decreases arterial pressure. In contrast to diltiazem and verapamil, nicardipine does not substantially depress myocardial contractility nor does the drug affect the rate of sinoatrial node firing. As a result, stroke volume and cardiac output are relatively preserved or may increase. Nicardipine-induced decreases in arterial pressure trigger increases in heart rate through activation of baroreceptor reflexes, but the tachycardia observed during administration of nicardipine is less pronounced than typically occurs with sodium nitroprusside at comparable levels of arterial pressure. Nicardipine is also a highly potent coronary vasodilator and is often used to dilate arterial grafts during CABG surgery. Because of its relative long half-life, nicardipine is primarily used for treatment of sustained perioperative hypertension and not for acute, often transient hypertensive episodes that are commonly observed during surgery.</p>
<h6 class="h6">Clevidipine</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Clevidipine is an ultrashort-acting dihydropyridine L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel antagonist with a plasma half-life of approximately 2&#x00A0;minutes after intravenous administration. Like nicardipine and nifedipine, clevidipine exerts pronounced effects at the less negative resting membrane potentials typically observed in vascular smooth muscle cells, but demonstrates lower potency in cardiac myocytes in which resting membrane potentials are substantially more negative. As a result of these differences in cellular electrophysiology, clevidipine is highly selective for arterial vascular smooth muscle and is nearly devoid of negative chronotropic or inotropic effects. This hemodynamic profile may be especially useful for the treatment of hypertension in patients with<a id="page285"></a> compromised LV function. Clevidipine causes dose-related arteriolar vasodilation while sparing venous vasomotor tone, thereby reducing systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure without affecting LV preload. These actions may combine to augment cardiac output. Modest increases in heart rate may also occur during administration of clevidipine as a result of baroreceptor reflex activation. Unlike other short-acting antihypertensive drugs, administration of clevidipine is not associated with the development of tachyphylaxis, and abrupt discontinuation of the drug does not appear to cause rebound hypertension. Because tissue and plasma esterases are responsible for clevidipine metabolism, little to no accumulation of the drug occurs even in the setting of hepatic or kidney dysfunction.</p>
