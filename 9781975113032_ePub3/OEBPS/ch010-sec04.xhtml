<h5 class="h5" id="sen132">A. Endogenous Opioids</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Endogenous opioids are neuropeptides that are produced within the pituitary gland and include endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins. Endomorphins have been identified, but their function is still under investigation. These peptides are formed from large protein precursors and act as neurotransmitters.<a id="page196"></a> Endogenous opioids are involved in circuits related to pain modulation, reward, stress response, and autonomic control. Opioids modulate other physiologic processes including endocrine and immune functions, GI transit, ventilation, and mood. <em>&#x03B2;</em>-Endorphins bind to multiple opioid receptors and decrease pain, modulate euphoria, and cause other effects. Enkephalins alter calcium influx and facilitate hyperpolarization of neurons. In the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord, enkephalins modulate pain perception. The periaqueductal gray in the brain also contains enkephalins that modulate analgesia and inhibit the release of excitatory neurotransmitters. Overall, <em>&#x03B2;</em>-endorphins and enkephalins have the greatest affinity for the <em>&#x00B5;</em>- and <em>&#x03B4;</em>-opioid receptors, whereas dynorphins have a greater affinity for <em>&#x03BA;</em>-receptors, but all endogenous opioids bind classical opioid receptors. Endogenous opioids and opioid receptors are located throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen133">B. Opioid Receptors</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Opioid receptors include the classical <em>&#x00B5;</em>, <em>&#x03B4;</em>, <em>&#x03BA;</em>, and the nonclassical nociceptin-orphanin opioid (or opioid receptor like-1) receptors that are seven transmembrane G-protein&#x2013;coupled receptors with intra- and extracellular loops and homology among the receptor subtypes. Other receptor subtypes have been suggested but have been dismissed because of lack of naloxone sensitivity. Activation of an opioid receptor facilitates pre- and postsynaptic inhibition that decreases neuronal excitability by inhibition of adenylate cyclase, therefore decreasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and calcium influx with increased potassium efflux leading to neuronal hyperpolarization. These mechanisms reduce neuronal excitability with consequential decrease in nerve impulse transmission and inhibition of neurotransmitter release. The differential location and expression of the opioid receptor subtypes provide a range of opioid-induced effects. The main analgesic effects of opioids result from central activation, whereas some of the side effects (reduced GI motility, urinary retention, and pruritus) result from activation of peripherally located opioid receptors. Peripherally acting opioid receptor antagonists, such as methylnaltrexone, treat opioid-induced constipation. Overall, <em>&#x00B5;</em>- and <em>&#x03B4;</em>-receptor agonism produces positive reinforcement, whereas <em>&#x03BA;</em>-receptor agonism provides the more negative effects of opioids (<strong><a href="#ff10-2">Figure 10.2</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><em>&#x00B5;-opioid receptor</em></strong> is located throughout the cerebral cortex, amygdala, basal ganglia, and periaqueductal gray. These receptors are also located presynaptically within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord where they inhibit glutamate release and transmission of nociceptive stimuli from C- and A-delta fibers. Side effects of <em>&#x00B5;</em>-receptor agonism include inhibition of GI peristalsis and respiratory depression because of a reduction in the sensitivity of chemoreceptors to hypercapnia. <em>&#x00B5;</em>-Opioid receptor knockout mice exhibit increased sensitivity to thermal pain; these knockout mice also lack the predicted effects and side effects of drugs that act on the <em>&#x00B5;</em>-opioid receptor.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><em>&#x03B4;</em></strong><strong><em>-opioid receptor</em></strong> exists in high densities within the cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens, and putamen. <em>&#x03B4;</em>-Receptor agonists are involved in analgesia, decreased GI mobility, and respiratory depression. The <em>&#x03B4;</em>-opioid receptor also modulates mood.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>&#x03BA;</em></strong><strong><em>-Opioid receptor</em></strong> activation causes sedation and hallucinations, but <em>&#x03BA;</em>-receptor agonists do not cause respiratory depression. <em>&#x03BA;</em>-Receptors are located within the nucleus raphe, which are part of the descending inhibitory pathway.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong><em>nociceptin-orphanin opioid receptor</em></strong>, in vitro, exhibits a pronociceptive, anti-analgesic effect supraspinally, but spinal agonism leads to analgesia<a id="page197"></a> at high doses balanced with hyperalgesia at low doses. These receptors are also located in the nucleus raphe. Nociceptin-orphanin receptor antagonists produce analgesia. Nociceptin-orphanin receptor knockout mice exhibit loss of tolerance to opioids. Consequently, this receptor may contribute to the development of tolerance observed with chronic opioid use.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen134">C. Mechanism of Opioid Analgesia</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Opioid receptors are part of descending inhibitory pathways that modulate the sensation of noxious stimuli. These receptors are localized in subcortical areas of the brain including the thalamus, periaqueductal gray, medulla, and locus coeruleus. Some of these areas are part of the limbic system, which is involved in reward pathways. The dorsal horn of the spinal cord, within lamina I and II, is involved in relaying nociceptive input to the brain. Nociceptive action potentials trigger the release of nociceptive transmitters, including <strong><em>substance P, glutamate, calcitonin gene&#x2013;related peptide</em></strong>, which relay this information<a id="page198"></a> via second-order neurons in ascending pathways. Opioids, therefore, inhibit spinal nociceptive transmission; cAMP signaling is reduced, which decreases the activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. In turn, nociceptive transmitters are not released. Postsynaptic neurons become hyperpolarized as potassium enters the cell.<sup><a href="#bib15">15</a>,<a href="#bib16">16</a></sup></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen135">D. Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia, Tolerance, and Dependence</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Opioid-induced <strong><em>hyperalgesia</em></strong> is a paradoxical situation in which a patient who is receiving chronic opioids becomes more sensitive to painful stimuli. The exact neurobiochemical mechanism is thought to arise from changes in the peripheral and CNS that cause sensitization of pronociceptive pathways. These mechanisms involve the central glutaminergic system, NMDA receptor activation, increased release of spinal neuropeptides, and descending pathway facilitation.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">With continued use, the tolerance to the analgesic effects of opioids increases more than tolerance to the respiratory depressant effects, thus narrowing the therapeutic window.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">A prolonged drug administration that results in a loss of drug potency and requires a higher dosage to achieve the same desired effect is defined as <strong><em>tolerance</em></strong>. A patient who exhibits opioid tolerance will require a higher dose of opioids to achieve his or her prior analgesic level. Mechanisms that lead to the development of tolerance include upregulation of drug metabolism, desensitization of receptor signaling, and receptor downregulation. The FDA defines tolerance as 60&#x00A0;mg morphine equivalents daily. Analgesic tolerance increases more than respiratory depressant tolerance; therefore, as dosages increase, the therapeutic window becomes narrower. Both opioid tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia seem to require increased dosing of opioids for analgesic effect, but opioids worsen patients&#x2019; opioid-induced hyperalgesia. In both cases, multimodal analgesia and NMDA receptor antagonists are helpful to provide analgesia.</p>
<p class="indent">Opioid <strong><em>dependence</em></strong> occurs when a patient continues to use a medication to avoid withdrawal syndromes. Addiction occurs with drug craving and compulsive use. Neurobiological dependence has been tied to the locus coeruleus and mesolimbic system within the brain.</p>

<p class="video2"><strong>Opioid Pharmacodynamics</strong></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen136">E. Routes of Administration</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Opioids may be administered parenterally, orally, sublingually, transdermally, and intranasally. Most commonly, opioids are administered either via the intravenous or oral route, but some can be administered intrathecally or epidurally, such as fentanyl or preservative-free morphine. Fentanyl and buprenorphine are also marketed as transdermal patches. Fentanyl can be given buccally.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen137">F. Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Plasma and effect site concentrations are important to understand opioid behavior. Medications, like alfentanil, with quick transfer between plasma and effect site, the brain, show that an intravenous dose exerts a quick analgesic response. This example highlights the importance of understanding concepts that define drug kinetics including <strong><em>time to peak effect after bolus</em></strong><strong>,</strong> <strong><em>time to steady state</em></strong> after starting an infusion, and <strong><em>context-sensitive half-life</em></strong>. <strong><a href="#ff10-3">Figure 10.3</a></strong> exhibits common bolus front-end and back-end kinetics of various opioids. When rapid onset analgesia is desired, a rapid onset opioid is most useful, such as remifentanil, alfentanil, or fentanyl. These exert their effects more rapidly than morphine. When using an opioid infusion, it is critical to understand the time to <strong><em>steady-state plasma concentration</em></strong>. Plasma concentrations of opioids, except remifentanil, continue to rise for hours after an infusion is initiated. On the contrary, remifentanil infusions, when started with a bolus dose, reach steady state quickly (<strong><a href="#ff10-4">Figure 10.4</a></strong>). After an infusion is stopped, the <strong><em>context-sensitive half-life</em></strong> is important to anticipate when a drugs effect may terminate. The context-sensitive half-life is the time after an infusion is stopped in which a 50% decrease in effect site concentration occurs. Understanding these definitions will guide a clinician toward appropriate opioid choices and uses. <strong><a href="#tt10-2">Table 10.2</a></strong> lists opioid equipotent doses.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen138">G. Therapeutic Effects</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Opioids act centrally and peripherally to minimize noxious stimuli and modify the affective response to noxious stimuli. Opioids, especially <em>&#x00B5;</em>-receptor agonists, are most effective at treating pain carried by slow, <strong><em>unmyelinated C fibers</em></strong>. Neuropathic pain and pain transmitted by fast, myelinated A-<em>&#x03B4;</em> fibers are not as effectively treated with opioids. The goal of opioid therapy is analgesia, not amnesia or unresponsiveness. Opioid effects include sedation and suppression of the cough reflex in the medulla, but sometimes, a bolus dose may result in coughing with induction of anesthesia.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen139">H. Adverse Effects</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Opioids cause blunting of the normal ventilatory response to increases in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pa<small>CO</small><sub><small>2</small></sub>>). Measured, titrated administration of opioids results in slower respiratory depression and hypercapnia such that the body may be able to maintain minute ventilation. A larger bolus, which could cause a rapid increase in the concentration of opioid, would blunt this response and lead to apnea. Once the <strong><em>apneic threshold</em></strong> is reached, the patient may breathe again. The apneic threshold is the highest Pa<small>CO</small><sub><small>2</small></sub> level at which a patient does not breathe. Opioids reliably decrease respiratory rate. Tidal volumes may slightly increase when opiates are used alone in lower doses but decrease at higher doses or when combined with other sedatives and anesthetics. Concomitant use of other medications or factors that are CNS depressants, such as benzodiazepines, large doses of opioids, older age, and hepatic or renal insufficiency, increase the risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">The factors that increase the risk of opioid ventilatory depression include high dose, natural sleep, old age, other CNS depressants, and decreased clearance due to hepatic or renal insufficiency.</p>

<p class="indent">Opioids promote parasympathetic over sympathetic activity. When used intraoperatively, this parasympathetic tone manifests as cardiovascular changes; opioids, however, do not have direct cardiovascular depressant effects. Some opioids, such as fentanyl, increase vagal tone and manifest as bradycardia. Chest wall rigidity may be seen following bolus doses of fentanyl or its congeners, which may impair adequate bag mask ventilation.</p>
<p class="indent">Opioids may modulate immune function as opioid receptors exist on immune cells. Opioids may be immunosuppressant, but new data suggest they may play a dual role, although the exact mechanism of opioids and their relation to immune function has yet to be elucidated.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen140">I. Metabolism and Active Metabolites</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Opioid metabolism generally occurs in the liver by the hepatic cytochrome system. They are highly protein bound and ionized at physiologic pH. Remifentanil is one opioid that is a major exception to this opioid metabolism generalization and is discussed below.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen141">J. Drug Interactions</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Sedative drugs, such as benzodiazepines, act <strong><em>synergistically</em></strong> with opioids to provide greater sedation from their combination rather than from each medication alone. Similarly, gabapentinoids also exhibit synergistic effects of respiratory depression when combined with opioids. In 2019, the FDA issued a new warning regarding respiratory depression with gabapentinoid use and risk of opioid overdose when used in combination with opioids. The synergistic effect of administering an opioid with a benzodiazepine is illustrated in <strong><a href="#ff10-5">Figure 10.5</a></strong>, and a similar effect is seen with propofol (<strong><a href="#ff10-6">Figure 10.6</a></strong>). Opioids, when used at moderate doses intraoperatively, decrease the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of volatile anesthetics as much as 75%.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen142">K. Pharmacogenetics and Special Populations</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Codeine, a more common outpatient analgesic than inpatient analgesic, may not provide analgesia to patients equally. Codeine is a <strong><em>prodrug</em></strong>; it must be metabolized to morphine to exert an effect. It is metabolized by the CYP450 enzyme, CYP2D6, but in some of the population, this isoform is lacking. The CYP2D6 isoform can be inhibited by other drugs, like fluoxetine or bupropion, rendering a limited response to codeine. Patients exhibit a normal response to morphine even if they may not exhibit a normal cleavage of codeine. Other opioids, including tramadol, hydrocodone, and oxycodone, are also metabolized by the CYP2D6 isoform. <strong><em>Poor metabolizers</em></strong> exhibit a decreased analgesic response to these drugs. On the contrary, some patients are <strong><em>ultrarapid metabolizers</em></strong>. Approximately 1% to 2% of the population falls into this category in which they have duplicated functional genes for CYP2D6. As such, these patients metabolize codeine to morphine more rapidly and completely. These patients may then exhibit symptoms of morphine overdose. This clinical effect was seen in pediatric deaths following tonsillectomy, so in 2013, the FDA issued a black box warning against using codeine in pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy. Older patients, specifically those older than 65 years, are more sensitive to opioids, and their dosages should be reduced by 50%. Genetic investigations may shed further light on differences in opioid metabolism and responsiveness.</p>

<p class="indent">Patients with liver failure or hepatic encephalopathy are particularly sensitive to the sedative effects of opioids. Opioid metabolism is not affected<a id="page204"></a> by patients with alterations in their liver function, but the anhepatic phase of orthotopic liver transplantation alters opioid metabolism. Renal failure causes significant accumulation of active metabolites of morphine and meperidine, morphine-6-glucuronide and normeperidine respectively, which causes adverse effects. Morphine-6-glucuronide causes respiratory depression, and normeperidine can cause CNS excitation and seizures. The unique metabolism of remifentanil renders it safe in patients with significant liver or renal failure.</p>
<p class="indent">Further research will elucidate the behavior of opioids in patients with obesity. As obesity continues to increase throughout our population, clinicians should avoid administration of opioids based on total body weight. Dosing guidelines are generally based on total body weight, but often, patients with morbid obesity are not accounted for in these dosing guidelines. A limited number of studies have assessed <strong><em>dosing scalars</em></strong> other than total body weight in patients with obesity. A dosing scalar, or dosing medications based on individual patient characteristics including age, weight, gender, and comorbidities, is useful coupled with titrations based on clinical effect. Dosing based on ideal body weight may result in subtherapeutic doses in populations with obesity, whereas doses based on total body weight may result in excess drug plasma concentrations. A high percentage of ASA Closed Claims are related to adverse respiratory events secondary to opioids in patients with obesity.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen143">L. Indications, Doses, and Special Considerations</h5>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>1. Morphine</strong></h6>
<p class="nonindent">Morphine has been well studied and is the prototypical opioid. Morphine is <strong><em>poorly lipid soluble</em></strong> and <strong><em>hydrophilic</em></strong>; therefore, it enters the CNS slowly and peaks approximately 90 minutes after intravenous injection. Histamine release after morphine injection is well known. Morphine undergoes extensive <strong><em>first-pass metabolism</em></strong> after oral administration, and the active metabolite, morphine-6-glucuronide, is a by-product. Oral morphine can be administered as an immediate-release or sustained-release formulation. (See <strong><a href="#tt10-3">Table 10.3</a></strong> for typical bolus doses of opioids.)</p>

<a id="page205"></a>
<h6 class="h6">2. Hydromorphone</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Hydromorphone is a <strong><em>synthetic opioid</em></strong> with an onset time similar to morphine but reaches peak effect more quickly, within about 15 minutes. Hydromorphone is more lipophilic than morphine. Oral hydromorphone can be administered as an immediate-release or sustained-release formulation.</p>
<h6 class="h6">3. Meperidine</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Meperidine is no longer commonly used as an analgesic today. It is used for anesthetic-related shivering in the postanesthesia care unit. Meperidine is contraindicated in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Meperidine produces an active metabolite, normeperidine, that accumulates in renal failure and causes seizures.</p>
<h6 class="h6">4. Fentanyl</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Fentanyl is highly lipophilic; therefore, it crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly. Fentanyl can be administered intravenously, intranasally, transdermally, and transmucosally. After an intravenous bolus, fentanyl reaches peak effect in 3 to 5 minutes with an analgesic effect that lasts 30 to 45 minutes. Peak respiratory depression occurs between 3 and 5 minutes after an intravenous dose. Fentanyl, however, has a long context-sensitive half-time (<strong><a href="#ff10-3">Figure 10.3C</a></strong>), which may detract from its use as a continuous infusion.</p>
<h6 class="h6">5. Sufentanil</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Sufentanil is the most <strong><em>potent</em></strong> commercially available opioid. It can be administered as a bolus, infusion, or within the intrathecal or epidural spaces. About 5&#x00A0;&#x03BC;g of intravenous sufentanil is the analgesic equivalent to 50&#x00A0;&#x03BC;g of fentanyl.</p>
<h6 class="h6">6. Alfentanil</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Alfentanil reaches peak effect rapidly, &#x223C;90 seconds after a bolus intravenous dose. The offset is also rapid (<strong><a href="ch010-sec02.xhtml#ff10-1">Figure 10.1</a></strong>). Alfentanil is metabolized by hepatic enzyme CYP3A4, but there is significant interindividual variability; thus the metabolism is less predictable.</p>
<h6 class="h6">7. Remifentanil</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Remifentanil is a potent intravenous opioid with a rapid onset (within 90 seconds) and short duration (&#x223C;3 minutes). Unlike other opioids, it is metabolized by <strong><em>ester hydrolysis</em></strong> in the plasma and tissues, which accounts for its rapid termination of action. Consequently, it is only used as a continuous infusion, not isolated boluses. Hepatic and renal failure have no impact on the metabolism of remifentanil. Remifentanil is easily titratable but has been implicated in postoperative hyperalgesia.</p>
<h6 class="h6">8. Methadone</h6>
<p class="nonindent">Methadone is available for enteral and intravenous use. It is often used as a maintenance therapy for patients with opioid use disorders because of its prolonged pharmacokinetics. Methadone is administered as a racemic mixture, but the dextrorotatory isomer has antagonist activity at the <strong><em>NMDA</em></strong> receptor, which attenuates the effects of opioid hyperalgesia and tolerance. Methadone prolongs the QT interval.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen144">M. Reversal Agents and Associated Effects</h5>
<p class="nonindent"><strong><em>Naloxone</em></strong> is a competitive antagonist at the opioid receptor and is used to reverse opioid intoxication or overdose. It has the greatest affinity for the <em>&#x00B5;</em>-opioid receptor and lowest affinity for the <em>&#x03BA;</em>-receptor. Without the presence of opioid, naloxone has no effect. Naloxone can be administered intravenously, intranasally, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly; it can also be administered as a buccal film or tablet in combination with buprenorphine, but naloxone is poorly absorbed after oral administration. Naloxone has a quick onset, but is rapidly metabolized in the liver; thus, naloxone&#x2019;s <strong><em>duration of action</em></strong> is shorter than the duration of the opioid whose effects it is intended to reverse. As such, patients can renarcotize after naloxone wears off. Naloxone can cause tachycardia, other signs of opioid withdrawal and, rarely, pulmonary edema. Naloxone appears to be safe in pregnancy and crosses the placenta. Naloxone is also on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines.</p>
<p class="headd"><em><strong>Did You Know?</strong></em></p>
<div class="boxd">
<p class="dify">Naloxone duration of action is usually substantially shorter than the opioids whose effects it is intended to reverse.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Nalbuphine</em></strong>, like <strong><em>butorphanol</em></strong>, is a mixed opioid agonist-antagonist. It can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly and can be given as an analgesic or to reverse <strong><em>opioid</em></strong><strong>-</strong><strong><em>induced pruritus</em></strong>. Commonly, it is used to attenuate side effects of opioids (ventilatory depression, pruritus) while maintaining some analgesia (partial <em>&#x03BA;</em>-agonism). Because of its affinity as a <em>&#x00B5;</em>-receptor antagonist, nalbuphine and butorphanol can precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients. The analgesic and respiratory effects of these agents reach a <strong><em>ceiling effect</em></strong> and do not decrease MAC as profoundly as morphine or fentanyl.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Buprenorphine</em></strong> has mixed agonist/antagonist activity at the classical opioid receptors. It has partial agonist activity at the <em>&#x00B5;</em>- and nociceptin-orphanin opioid receptors. At low and intermediate doses, an analgesic response is created, but at higher doses, the analgesic effects may be decreased, a <strong><em>ceiling effect</em></strong>. Buprenorphine exhibits <em>&#x03BA;</em>-antagonism. When buprenorphine is administered with full opioid agonists, such as morphine, it can displace the <em>&#x00B5;</em>-receptor binding of morphine. Buprenorphine is used as an analgesic and in patients with a history of opioid use disorder.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Methylnaltrexone</em></strong> is a peripherally acting <em>&#x00B5;</em>-opioid receptor antagonist that reverses the side effects of opioids, including constipation, without affecting analgesia or precipitating withdrawal. Methylnaltrexone does not cross the blood-brain barrier because it is a quaternary ammonium cation.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong><em>Naltrexone</em></strong> is available as an oral formulation and intramuscular depot and is a competitive opioid antagonist. If administered to a patient who has received opioids, naltrexone will precipitate withdrawal. Naltrexone is metabolized in the liver to an active metabolite. They are both competitive antagonists at the <em>&#x00B5;</em>-opioid receptor, the <em>&#x03BA;</em>-opioid receptor to a lesser extent, and the <em>&#x03B4;</em>-opioid receptor to an even lesser extent. Naltrexone is used in patients who have a history of opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder.</p>
