<p class="nonindent">Perioperative AKI is a complication associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Recent studies suggest the incidence of AKI after noncardiac surgery is about 6%; after cardiac surgery, the incidence approaches 30%. Mortality among patients who experience postoperative AKI is up to three times higher than those who do not. Furthermore, only about half of patients who experience AKI will have a return to baseline renal function. Prevention and management of perioperative AKI is therefore vital.<sup><a href="ch005-sec05.xhtml#bib10">10</a>-<a href="ch005-sec05.xhtml#bib12">12</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes, AKI is defined as an increase in serum creatinine of 0.3&#x00A0;mg/dL or more within 48 hours or a 1.5-fold or greater increase from baseline within 7&#x00A0;days (<strong><a href="#ff5-9">Figure 5.9</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="indent">Although overly simplistic, the etiology of AKI has historically been divided into prerenal, intrarenal (or intrinsic), and postrenal causes (<strong><a href="#tt5-9">Table 5.9</a></strong>). Prerenal AKI is the most common form of hospital-acquired AKI. When renal ischemia is prolonged, tubular injury ensues and the clinical picture is suggestive of intrinsic AKI. Urinary indices are helpful in distinguishing the etiology of AKI (<strong><a href="ch005-sec02.xhtml#tt5-5">Tables 5.5</a></strong> and <strong><a href="ch005-sec02.xhtml#tt5-6">5.6</a></strong>). Postrenal AKI is caused by an obstruction distal to the nephron. It is the least common form of AKI, but the most preventable. Renal ultrasonography is often the test of choice for ruling out the presence of obstructive nephropathy.</p>

<p class="indent">Patient-associated risk factors for the development of AKI include preexisting renal disease, advanced age, African American race, preexisting hypertension, congestive heart failure, pulmonary disease, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, the presence of ascites, and high body mass index. Procedure-associated risk factors include emergency surgery,<a id="page104"></a> cardiac or major vascular surgery, prolonged aortic cross-clamp time, the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, intraoperative blood transfusions, episodes of intraoperative hypotension, and the use of vasopressors and diuretics.</p>
<p class="indent">Pharmacologic interventions to treat and prevent perioperative AKI have remained elusive. Neither dopamine nor the dopamine analogue fenoldopam has shown benefit in the prevention or management of AKI. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is the only treatment for severe AKI. Indications for RRT include metabolic acidosis, severe electrolyte abnormalities, fluid overload, and signs or symptoms of severe uremia. There is no indication that the timing of RRT&#x2014;early versus late&#x2014;significantly affects outcomes, so the decision to initiate RRT is best made based on a patient-to-patient basis on symptom severity.</p>
