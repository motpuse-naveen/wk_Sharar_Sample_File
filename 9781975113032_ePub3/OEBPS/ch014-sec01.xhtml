<p class="nonindent">In its entirety, the anesthesia workstation encompasses a broad range of equipment, including the anesthesia machine, physiologic monitors, and accessories such as active suction equipment and adjunctive bag valve mask device. Patient monitoring and airway management are discussed elsewhere. The remainder of this chapter directs attention specifically to the anesthesia machine. The basic construct of the anesthesia machine is defined by three concepts (<strong><a href="#ff14-1">Figure 14.1</a></strong>). The first is a system that originates with a <strong><em>gas</em></strong>; typically, this is pressurized oxygen/air delivered from a central hospital source, directly into the operating room. A series of <strong><em>pressure-reducing systems</em></strong> follows, after which<a id="page288"></a> the anesthesiologist directly controls the flow of these gases to achieve the desired flow rate and oxygen concentration that is delivered to the second system. Integrated into this gas delivery design is the anesthetic <strong><em>vaporizer</em></strong>, which allows for the administration of volatile anesthetic to the patient.</p>

<p class="indent">The system described above converges on the <strong><em>fresh gas outlet</em></strong>, which delivers the desired concentrations of gases and volatile anesthetics into the next conceptual framework (system) of the anesthesia machine: the <strong><em>anesthesia breathing apparatus</em></strong>. Patient ventilation is achieved using either the automated controlled mechanical ventilator or manually through the breathing bag, both of which are incorporated into a system of corrugated tubes and unidirectional valves known as the <strong><em>circle system</em></strong>. This design enables reciprocal inflation and deflation of the patient&#x2019;s lungs with the ventilator or breathing bag. It also incorporates an absorbent compound to neutralize expired carbon dioxide.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, there must be a mechanism to remove excess gas or pressure from the system. This is accomplished through another structural arrangement, the <strong><em>scavenging system.</em></strong> The mechanics, safeguards, and hazards of each of these three systems will be discussed below.</p>
