<p class="nonindent">Introduction of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide are essential to normal cellular metabolism. Movement of these gases between the environment and tissue is complex, relying on both simple diffusion and carrier molecules.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="sen27">A. Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Transport in Lungs</h5>
<p class="nonindent">Oxygen is first inhaled from the environment and travels down the airways as a component of air by convection secondary to the force generated from the energy of inspiration. As air reaches the distal airways, diffusion becomes the predominant mode of gas transport (<strong><a href="#ff2-5">Figure 2.5</a></strong>). Diffusion allows for movement of molecules across a distance to an area of lower concentration in an energy-independent manner. The pulmonary capillaries transport blood to alveoli, which has a lower partial pressure of oxygen than the air entrained into the alveoli. The lower partial<a id="page22"></a> pressure of oxygen in blood creates a diffusion gradient, allowing oxygen to diffuse across the alveolar membrane into the pulmonary capillary bed. Relative concentrations of oxygen drive the movement of oxygen into the blood. This phenomenon also allows oxygenation in the absence of ventilation, apneic oxygenation, provided a diffusion gradient is present. Similarly, pulmonary capillary blood arrives at the alveoli with a relatively rich carbon dioxide concentration, allowing carbon dioxide to diffuse from the blood into the alveoli. The pulmonary diffusion capacity or the ability of carbon dioxide to pass between the alveoli to blood is 20 times greater than oxygen, allowing for it to diffuse across the alveolar membrane with greater efficiency. After oxygen diffuses from the alveoli to the pulmonary capillary bed, oxygen from terminal airways will then diffuse into the alveoli. Concurrently, carbon dioxide newly introduced into the alveoli is transported along a diffusion gradient in a reverse pathway until it reaches the upper airways for exhalation by ventilation. The pulmonary capillary blood, which has now absorbed oxygen from and released carbon dioxide to the alveoli, propagates forward. This exchange allows for new oxygen-poor and carbon dioxide&#x2013;rich blood to interact with the alveoli. By this process, diffusion allows for oxygen and carbon dioxide to be exchanged at the alveoli&#x2013;pulmonary capillary interface. Note that diffusion is a passive process. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are not actively selected. If the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli is decreased by significantly elevated carbon dioxide levels, diffusion hypoxia may result as the diffusion gradient for oxygen is diminished. Diffusion allows gas exchange to occur along a concentration gradient from the airways across the alveolar-capillary membrane to the blood.</p>

<h5 class="h5" id="sen28">B. Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Transport in Blood</h5>
<p class="nonindent">The transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood depends on hemoglobin.<sup><a href="ch002-sec13.xhtml#bib10">10</a></sup> Oxygen is transported in the blood both bound to hemoglobin and dissolved in blood. Oxygen dissolved in blood is a small fraction of the amount bound to hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a complex molecule consisting of four heme subunits, with each subunit binding a molecule of oxygen. The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is illustrated by the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation<a id="page23"></a> curve (<strong><a href="#ff2-6">Figure 2.6</a></strong>). The curve demonstrates two important concepts. First, it demonstrates that hemoglobin allows the blood to carry a large content of oxygen, even at the low partial pressure of 60&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg of oxygen. Second, the linear part of the curve allows for delivery of a significant amount of oxygen with just a slight change in partial pressures of oxygen, allowing for oxygen unloading to tissues. The affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is altered under certain conditions. Affinity for oxygen by hemoglobin is decreased by acidosis, elevation in temperature, and increased levels of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (a by-product of red blood cell metabolism), which aids partially deoxygenated hemoglobin to release further oxygen. This decreased affinity, however, is beneficial as it allows for unloading of oxygen from hemoglobin in tissues with higher metabolic requirements, as evidenced by increased acidosis, temperature, and deoxygenated hemoglobin. The Bohr effect specifically describes hemoglobin&#x2019;s decreased affinity for oxygen in environments with carbon dioxide elevation or acidosis.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ff2-6"><figure class="figure"><img src="images/ff2-6.jpg" alt="img"/><figcaption class="caption"><span class="fignum">Figure&#160;2.6</span> The oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve (blue curve) demonstrates that a majority of oxygen content is bound to hemoglobin at partial pressures of 60&#x00A0;mm&#x00A0;Hg. The linear portion of the curve allows for oxygen unloading at partial pressures of oxygen found in the peripheral systemic capillary beds, the site of tissue oxygenation. Furthermore, increases in acidosis, temperature, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate decrease hemoglobin&#x2019;s affinity for oxygen, allowing for increased oxygen supply to areas with increased metabolic needs as evidenced by increase temperature, acidosis, and deoxygenated hemoglobin. Of note, the majority of oxygen content is found bound to hemoglobin, as seen by the small portion of oxygen content supplied by oxygen dissolved in blood (<em>red curve</em>).</figcaption></figure></div>

<p class="indent">Carbon dioxide is transported in the blood in three different forms (<strong><a href="#ff2-7">Figure 2.7</a></strong>). It is either dissolved in blood, transported as bicarbonate, or exists a carbamino compound. The solubility of carbon dioxide is much greater than oxygen, accounting for approximately 10% of the carbon dioxide transported in venous blood. Bicarbonate, the form in which the bulk of carbon dioxide is transported, is formed by carbonic anhydrase enzymes in the red blood cells. The formation of bicarbonate results in hydrogen ions as a by-product. As hemoglobin releases oxygen, it becomes deoxygenated and readily accepts hydrogen ions, acting as a buffer and favoring the formation of further<a id="page24"></a> bicarbonate. Additionally, deoxygenated hemoglobin buffered with hydrogen ions can bind carbon dioxide, allowing transport in the form of a carbamino compound. The <strong><em>Haldane effect</em></strong> is the ability of deoxygenated hemoglobin to transport carbon dioxide by facilitating the formation of bicarbonate and acting as a buffer for formed hydrogen ions and as a carbamino compound. Basically, the ability of blood to transport carbon dioxide is increased with lower oxygen concentrations.</p>
